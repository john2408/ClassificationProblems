The stable way of business life many corporate purchasing departments enjoy has been increasingly imperiled.;0;;;;;
As dozens of companies have already learned, supply and demand patterns can be upset virtually overnight.;0;;;;;
What capabilities will a profitable international business need to sustain itself in the face of strong protectionist pressures?;0;;;;;
Almost every kind of manufacturer will have to answer these questions.;0;;;;;
Some companies have already responded to the growing pressures.;0;;;;;
Finding that purchasing outlays had increased in less than one year to 70% of the cost of goods sold, one European office-equipment manufacturer began to rely more heavily on American and Japanese suppliers, revise its materials planning system to reduce in-process inventories, and require its divisions to add people with electronics and foreign language skills to their purchasing staffs.;0;;;;;
We have established ties to a foreign country and recently acquired another company as part of their new purchasing strategies.;4;;;;;
In many companies, purchasing, perhaps more than any other business function, is wedded to routine.;0;;;;;
Ignoring or accepting countless economic and political disruptions to their supply of materials, companies continue to negotiate annually with their established networks of suppliers or sources.;4;;;;;
But many purchasing managers skills and outlooks were formed 20 years ago in an era of relative stability, and they have not changed.;0;;;;;
Now no company can allow purchasing to lag behind other departments in acknowledging and adjusting to worldwide environmental and economic changes.;0;;;;;
Such an attitude is not only obsolete but also costly.;0;;;;;
The author offers pragmatic advice on how top management can recognize the extent of its own supply weakness and treat it with a comprehensive strategy to manage supply.;0;;;;;
He leads the reader step by step from the roots of the problem to the implementation of a solution.;0;;;;;
US auto manufacturers who customarily relied on domestic materials procurement are now reevaluating their supply schemes and broadening their scope of potential suppliers.;1;;;;;
Ford not only manufactures parts of its world car in several foreign subsidiaries but also buys transmission axles from its Japanese subsidiary.;0;;;;;
Chrysler, which was sourcing engines from Volkswagen, now buys engines from Mitsubishi.;0;;;;;
"Predictions are the US car industry will source 40% of its parts and components from abroad; 15 years ago it sourced only 5% from other countries.";0;;;;;
Others that already source on a global basis must learn to cope with uncertainties and supply or price disruptions on an unprecedented scale.;3;;;;;
Instead of simply monitoring current developments, management must learn to make things happen to its own advantage.;0;;;;;
This calls for nothing less than a total change of perspective: from purchasing) to supply management.;0;;;;;
Whenever a manufacturer must procure a volume of critical items competitively under complex conditions, supply management is relevant.;0;;;;;
Attractive new options, or serious vulnerabilities, or both, may come to light as the assessment explores questions like these.;0;;;;;
Supply is highly vulnerable to production problems.;3;;;;;
Is the company making good use of opportunities for concerted action among different divisions and/or subsidiaries?;0;;;;;
Combining the supply requirements of different divisions can increase the corporation's total buying clout.;2;;;;;
One international transportation company was buying three kinds of fuel separately: bunker oil for shipping, jet fuel for airfreight, and gasoline for trucks.;0;;;;;
The company's top management promptly ordered a change in purchasing policy to build up alternative domestic sources.;3;;;;;
A company can often take action to lessen unacceptable risk.;3;;;;;
What make-or-buy policies will give the best balance between cost and flexibility to cope with supply bottlenecks?;3;;;;;
Shaping the Supply Strategy To minimize their supply vulnerabilities is key to deal with difficult sourcing challenges.;3;;;;;
The approach has given them a simple but effective framework for collecting marketing and corporate data, forecasting future supply scenarios, and identifying available purchasing options as well as for developing individual supply strategies.;0;;;;;
A low availablilty of supply sources increases the supply risk.;3;;;;;
Low availability of scarce materials contributes to a higher risk profile of a company.;3;;;;;
Following this approach, the company first classifies all its purchased materials or components in terms of profit impact and supply risk.;0;;;;;
Next it analyzes the supply market for these materials.;0;;;;;
Then it determines its overall strategic supply position.;0;;;;;
It develops materials strategies and action plans.;0;;;;;
;0;;;;;
Supply risk is assessed in terms of availability, number of suppliers, competitive demand, make-or-buy opportunities, and storage risks and substitution possibilities.;0;;;;;
Each of these four categories requires a distinctive purchasing approach, whose complexity is in proportion to the strategic implications.;0;;;;;
As companies like Akzo, the giant Dutch chemical producer, have found, this classification permits a more differentiated and hence better focused approach to the analysis of supply market data.;0;;;;;
Shifts in supply or demand patterns can alter a material's strategic category.;0;;;;;
Therefore, any purchasing portfolio classification calls for regular updating.;0;;;;;
Phase 2: Market Analysis: Next the company weights the bargaining power of its suppliers against its own strength as a customer.;0;;;;;
It systematically reviews the supply market, assessing the availability of strategic materials in terms of both quality and quantity, and the relative strength of existing vendors.;0;;;;;
The company then analyzes its own needs and supply lines to gauge its ability to get the kind of supply terms it wants.;0;;;;;
Of the contrasting criteria of supplier and company strength listed in Exhibit III, some are self-explanatory.;0;;;;;
But six call for special comment.;0;;;;;
Supplier's break-even stability: A supplier that achieves break-even at below 70% capacity utilization can ultimately deliver at lower cost than one who breaks even at 80% utilization.;0;;;;;
Annual volume purchased and expected growth in demand: Volume, the main determinant of the company's overall bargaining power, is critical because economies of scale in purchasing often yield a decisive competitive cost advantage.;0;;;;;
In the case of many automotive parts, cost reductions as large as 4% can often be achieved by doubling the volume allocated to a given supplier.;0;;;;;
Past variations in capacity utilization of main production units.;0;;;;;
A company can judge the built-in flexibility of its supply coverage from past variations in demand resulting from sales strategies and promotions, changes in the order backlog, or overall economic conditions.;0;;;;;
In turn, projected profits may decline.;0;;;;;
Potential costs in the event of nondelivery or inadequate quality: The higher such costs and the greater the risk of incurring them, the less latitude the company has for rapidly shifting supply sources or delaying negotiations or contracts.;0;;;;;
These costs influence required inventory levels and safety stocks, but they mainly affect production.;0;;;;;
Changing a source of supply might, for example, make it necessary to modify the production process.;0;;;;;
In the case of materials for highly automated production processes, the costs of such modification could be prohibitive.;0;;;;;
No list of evaluation criteria is equally applicable to every industry: a petrochemicals producer and an automobile manufacturer would each have its own modifications to those shown in the exhibit.;0;;;;;
Moreover, the relative importance of different criteria may vary with technological change or with shifts in the industry's competitive dynamics.;0;;;;;
Careful definition of the criteria of both supplier and company strength is a prerequisite to accurate market analysis.;0;;;;;
The purchasing portfolio matrix plots company buying strength against the strengths of the supply market and can be used to develop counterstrategies key suppliers' an approach sometimes called reverse marketing.;0;;;;;
The cells in the purchasing portfolio matrix correspond to three basic risk categories, each associated with a different strategic thrust.;0;;;;;
Usually, a company will find itself in different roles with respect to different items and suppliers.;0;;;;;
The end product will be a set of systematically documented strategies for critical purchasing materials that specify the timing of and criteria for future action.;0;;;;;
The usefulness of the purchasing portfolio approach in a variety of industrial situations can be seen in the diverse experiences of four large companies.;0;;;;;
Not long ago a welding materials producer with plants and sales operations all over Europe found its profits squeezed by increased competition and slackening market growth.;0;;;;;
Searching for ways to improve the picture, the company found that supplies were critical to the production of its welding wires and electrodes.;0;;;;;
Together, just five out of the 470 different items it purchased accounted for more than 60% of the company's total purchasing volume of $135 million.;0;;;;;
Taking into account demand growth, quality standards, and logistics, the company then analyzed the European market for these five items in light of its own plant-by-plant requirements.;0;;;;;
A third step determined the company's position against a wide range of individual suppliers and assessed the risk of increasing the share sourced from each one.;0;;;;;
Finally, the company developed several strategic supply scenarios, each involving a different mix of suppliers and different assumptions about price, volume, and risk.;0;;;;;
The scenarios ranged from very low risk (total dependence on well-established sources) to very high (most purchases from lesser-known, geographically dispersed suppliers).;0;;;;;
Cost-benefit analyses of each enabled management to pinpoint several opportunities for substantial improvement.;0;;;;;
On one key item alone, electrode wire, the company's potential annual savings ranged from $1.5 million to $6.3 million, or 3% to 12% of the total cost.;0;;;;;
Supply strategies the company worked out for other key items resulted in an overall saving of 10% on purchased materials, adding some 3% to 4% to the company's pretax profits.;0;;;;;
Action plans and decision and monitoring rules developed for each item enabled buyers to implement the new sourcing strategy and permitted management to monitor purchasing activities regularly, in some cases on a day-by-day or bid-by-bid basis.;0;;;;;
A large U.S.-based maker of electrical equipment categorized castings as a key strategic purchased item and systematically analyzed its own demand in terms of the annual volume and relative complexity of each type of casting.;0;;;;;
It assessed the capabilities of each potential supplier and decided, by comparing alternative supply scenarios, which was the best fit.;1;;;;;
The resulting new mix of outside suppliers reduced the company's outlays for castings by 5% to 15% and significantly improved its competitive cost position.;0;;;;;
Anxious to reduce the risks associated with current sources of feedstock supply, a multinational chemical company revamped its entire purchasing strategy and organization.;0;;;;;
Its risk profile, however, gave real cause for concern.;0;;;;;
Examining the supply market, it identified a group of obscure, small manufacturers of precision parts that had begun to use dedicated, numerically controlled equipment.;0;;;;;
Few companies today can allow purchasing to be managed in isolation from the other elements of their overall business systems.;0;;;;;
Greater integration, stronger cross-functional relations, and more top-management involvement are all necessary.;0;;;;;
Every facet of the purchasing organization, from systems support to top-management style, will ultimately need to adapt to these requirements.;0;;;;;
Concrete changes in the organization will be required to establish effective organizational relations, provide adequate systems support, and meet the new staff and skills requirements.;0;;;;;
In particular, top management must decide to what extent it should centralize or decentralize the function.;0;;;;;
The issue is not clear-cut.;0;;;;;
While centralization augments a company's purchasing clout, it is also more inflexible.;0;;;;;
To find the right balance, companies must carefully consider trade-offs between clout and flexibility.;0;;;;;
One diversified multinational corporation, for example, successfully centralized purchasing of basic materials but found that it could not do the same with technical goods because of heterogeneous production facilities, varying national standards, and differentiated service and parts demands.;0;;;;;
Another important issue is purchasing's position in the corporate structure.;0;;;;;
Should the company treat it as a function of production or of operating divisions?;0;;;;;
Should management set it up as a central independent department or division or position it as part of the materials management function or even of a supply division?;0;;;;;
The answer will depend on factors such as volume and concentration of purchased goods as well as on the corporation's structure and complexity.;0;;;;;
Different corporate philosophies lead to different solutions.;0;;;;;
One international chemical company, for example, formed a central supply group with world-wide responsibility for all raw materials, feedstocks, and energy-related activities, while a major competitor went for all-out decentralization and gave each division its own purchasing group.;0;;;;;
Though diametrically opposed, both solutions made sense in their respective contexts.;0;;;;;
The purchasing department's structure should reflect supply-product market affinities and permit staff with specialized competence to take the lead in working out strategies for specific items.;0;;;;;
The company should encourage flexibility and entrepreneurship in its managers within the constraints of the overall corporate structure.;0;;;;;
Systems Support Too often the purchasing department receives information on the company's business plans and objectives that is incomplete or improperly geared to the tasks and time horizons of strategic supply management.;0;;;;;
Purchasing executives are usually informed of major expansion and investment projects as well as month-to-month production requirements but often lack adequate operating information with a three- to six-month time horizon, which would provide early warning of short- to medium-term demand fluctuations.;0;;;;;
The purchasing department needs these data for negotiating prices, rescheduling supply quantities, and balancing raw material inventories in response to cyclical demand swings.;0;;;;;
Complex companies with numerous products, multiple plants, and substantial production for stock (as in the consumer goods or chemical industries) are more vulnerable than are companies with a single product line and or considerable job-order production, such as industrial equipment manufacturers.;0;;;;;
In either case, tailor-made systems support will be called for.;0;;;;;
Improvement of operational flexibility through a rolling demand forecast system with a three- to six- month time horizon, coupled with systematic evaluation of supply market data. ;0;;;;;
Improved efficiency, shortened through put time, and reduction in costs and manual paperwork through EDP-supported purchasing planning, information, and disposition systems. ;0;;;;;
Integration of purchasing systems with other corporate systems, such as liquidity planning, and/or with the corresponding planning and disposition systems of key suppliers.;0;;;;;
The most familiar example is the so-called Kanban system, which allows the Japanese automaker Nissan to work with practically no parts or work-in-process inventories.;0;;;;;
Recently, however, U.S. and European car manufacturers are moving in the same direction. ;0;;;;;
Improved systems support frees buyers and management from preoccupation with day-to-day problems and enables them to focus on long-term analytic work and planning.;0;;;;;
Additional benefits include price reduction or savings, inventory reduction, reduced clerical work, and better delivery and service.;0;;;;;
The company will realize these benefits only if it uses the systems effectively.;0;;;;;
It must foster consistent, cross-functional information flows and demands and induce line managers to supply the required data for the purchasing information system.;0;;;;;
One way to reduce their instinctive resistance is to show them that most of the data already exist and need only be recast in an appropriate format.;0;;;;;
Finally, management must make certain that any major new systems are user-friendly.;0;;;;;
To meet the demands of the new supply strategy, the company must also upgrade the skills and experience it requires of key purchasing people.;0;;;;;
One big international company vastly improved the status of the purchasing division by promoting a dynamic sales executive with broad international expertise to head it.;0;;;;;
To loosen its design department's grip on supplier selection decisions, another organization hired away an expert applications engineer from a specialized process-control manufacturer and put him in charge of the purchasing department.;0;;;;;
Top management should foster a constructive atmosphere and attitude among purchasing staff before undertaking any radical staff changes.;0;;;;;
Progress toward effective supply management can only be gradual, and the company will have to surmount many obstacles to implementation along the way.;0;;;;;
But the rewards are well worth the effort.;0;;;;;
"An attitude of purchasing as usual will make the company vulnerable to competitive pressure; but enhanced strategic awareness, greater flexibility, and stronger entrepreneurial thinking in the supply area can improve the supply security and lower the input costs of any industrial company.";0;;;;;
These products are characterized by sourcing from local suppliers.;1;;;;;
Noncritical items are usually sourced decentralized.;1;;;;;
Noncritical resources include standardized products with low supply risks.;1;;;;;
Noncritical item purchases are characterized by functional efficiency.;1;;;;;
Established local suppliers can easily supply buyers.;1;;;;;
Noncritical items are usually of low profit impact and low supply risk.;1;;;;;
Where noncritical items are concerned, simple market analyses, decision policies, and inventory optimization models will normally suffice.;1;;;;;
For supply items with neither major visible risks nor major benefits, a defensive posture would be over conservative and costly.;1;;;;;
Undue aggressiveness could damage supplier relations and lead to retaliation.;2;;;;;
A company should pursue a well-balanced intermediate strategy balance.;1;;;;;
Introduction of proven purchasing analysis approaches, such as commodity analysis or value analysis, to help develop action plans for nonstrategic purchased items with limited supply complexity and risk but up to 15% savings potential.;1;;;;;
Substantial savings through standardization and alternative sourcing of process-control equipment.;1;;;;;
Only after consolidating and combining these volumes at the corporate level could the company bring its true bargaining weight to bear.;2;;;;;
A manufacturer that relies solely on spot purchases may do well to mix spot purchases and supply contracts.;2;;;;;
If the company covers a large percentage of its supplies from sources it owns, it will be in a much better negotiating position to cover the remainder of its outside requirements than its less-integrated competitors.;2;;;;;
The company may find it more profitable to source outside if suppliers have chronic overcapacity.;2;;;;;
Leverage items are characterized by exploitation of full purchasing power.;2;;;;;
Purchases are often done by contract and spot purchasing mix.;2;;;;;
Often there are targeted pricing strategies and tough negotiations.;2;;;;;
Products are easily substituted are are therefore replaceable.;2;;;;;
Vendors can be selected according to need.;2;;;;;
Purchasing decisions are normally done decentralized.;2;;;;;
These items can be sourced chiefly local.;2;;;;;
Normally there are multiple suppliers.;2;;;;;
Often these items include a mix of commodities and specified materials.;2;;;;;
Items are characterized by a good cost to price mix.;2;;;;;
Buyer power is high.;2;;;;;
Usually you can find many alternative suppliers in this market.;2;;;;;
Order volume optimization, short- to medium-term demand planning.;2;;;;;
These items are usually of medium level, e.g. chief buyer.;2;;;;;
Leverage items have a high profit impact and a low supply risk.;2;;;;;
On items where the company plays a dominant market role and suppliers' strength is rated medium or low, a reasonably aggressive strategy exploit is indicated.;2;;;;;
Components are sourced aggressively.;2;;;;;
Because the supply risk is slight, the company has a better chance of achieving a positive profit contribution through favorable pricing and contract agreements.;2;;;;;
It has to take care not to exploit the advantage too aggressively that it jeopardizes long-term supplier relationships or provokes counter reactions by insisting on rock-bottom prices in times of market discontinuity.;2;;;;;
When it can bargain from a position of strength, it should press for preferential treatment.;2;;;;;
If the company is stronger than the suppliers, it can spread volume over several suppliers, exploit price advantages, increase spot purchases, and reduce inventory levels.;2;;;;;
"In this phase, then, the company should explore a range of supply scenarios in which it lays out its options for securing long-term supply and for exploiting short-term opportunities; clearly define respective risks, costs, returns, and strategic implications; and develop a preferred option with objectives, steps, responsibilities, and contingency measures laid out in detail for top management approval and implementation.";0;;;;;
They can explout power by getting price advanteges.;2;;;;;
Detailed analysis of both demand and supply confirmed that, thanks to the sheer volume of its purchases, the company enjoyed a strong position in most feedstock supply markets.;2;;;;;
Volume bundling is a common strategy.;2;;;;;
A corporate-level review revealed attractive trade-off and substitution opportunities, which the corporation soon set about exploiting, once it had changed and upgraded its purchasing organization and systems in order to do so.;2;;;;;
Optimize sourcing by bundling volumes to exploit price advantages.;2;;;;;
Effective relations to exploit the company's full buying and bargaining power, the purchasing function must reflect the overall corporate setup.;2;;;;;
Despite the potential leverage to be obtained through improved purchasing staff and skills, hasty moves in this area can backfire, especially if they disrupt close relationships with suppliers.;2;;;;;
Threats of resource depletion and raw materials scarcity, political turbulence and government intervention in supply markets, intensified competition, and accelerating technological change have ended the days of no surprises.;3;;;;;
How can a company guard against disastrous supply interruptions and cope with the changing economics and new opportunities brought on by new technologies?;3;;;;;
The greater the uncertainty of supplier relationships, technological developments, and physical availability of those items, the more important supply management becomes.;3;;;;;
Can the company avoid anticipated supply bottlenecks and interruptions.;3;;;;;
When an automotive parts maker analyzed its sintered metal components supply market, from which it had been sourcing for years, it discovered that political instability was jeopardizing its supply.;3;;;;;
Volume insurance are bought at cost premiums if necessary.;3;;;;;
 Backup plans have to created to ensure supply. ;3;;;;;
items are usually managed by higher management levels like the department heads.;3;;;;;
Bottleneck items are usually sourced focused on cost management.;3;;;;;
For scarce components usually buyers try to find short term suppliers.;3;;;;;
There is a production based scarcity.;3;;;;;
Suppliers can artificially shorten supply to create bottlenecks. ;3;;;;;
Usually suppliers offer new technological innovations.;3;;;;;
Components are often only avaible from a few suppliers. ;3;;;;;
Bottleneck items are characterized by low profit impact, but high supply risk.;3;;;;;
Decisions about bottleneck items may require specific market analysis and decision models for resolution.;3;;;;;
Vendor and value analysis, price forecasting models, and decision models may come into play on issues affecting leverage materials.;2;;;;;
Suppliers' capacity utilization is often low.;3;;;;;
 This criterion indicates the risk of supply bottlenecks.;3;;;;;
In a cyclical upswing, with suppliers' production running at low of capacity, the probability of a bottleneck in the supply of a strategic item is extremely high.;3;;;;;
Electronics manufacturers that have neither their own chip-production facilities nor adequate contractual coverage have nightmares whenever demand for microchips heats up.;3;;;;;
A European aircraft manufacturer had specified high-grade titanium alloys for certain applications but had failed to reckon with potential supply bottlenecks.;3;;;;;
After a series of production setbacks and cost increases, it has now switched back to specialty steels.;0;;;;;
The supplier will prove a tougher bargainer, it can more easily delay negotiations and accept capacity underutilization.;3;;;;;
 It can more easily delay negotiations and accept capacity underutilization.;3;;;;;
If a product is unique, the probability is less that alternative sources or suppliers will appear or that supplier competition will force cost reductions.;3;;;;;
Unique products have few alternative suppliers, which weakens the buyers position.;3;;;;;
If the company plans a major expansion or an aggressive sales strategy for a product line where supplies are tight or suppliers' capacities fully used, it may be able to cover the higher materials requirements only by paying a price premium.;3;;;;;
On items where the company's role in the supply market is secondary and suppliers are strong, the company must go on the defensive and start looking for material substitutes or new suppliers diversify.;3;;;;;
It may have to increase spending on market research or supplier relations, or even consider backward integration through major investments in R&D or production capacities.;3;;;;;
In short, the company needs its supply options.;0;;;;;
A buyer may even have to consider backward integration trhough major investments in Research and Development.;3;;;;;
Bargaining from weakness, the company may have to offer inducements longer-term contract obligations, or higher prices in order to ensure an adequate supply.;3;;;;;
To reduce the long-term risk of dependence on a single source, the company should also search for alternative suppliers or materials or even consider backward integration to permit in-house production.;3;;;;;
"Accordingly, the company spread its hydrocarbons procurement among petroleum- and coal-based feed- stocks; balanced its geographic base among Middle Eastern, African, North Sea, North American, and Latin American sources; changed its contracts-to- spot-purchases ratio; optimized its make-or-buy mix by integrating backward; and began to rely on wholly owned subsidiaries for a bigger share of its feedstock requirements.";0;;;;;
Supply bottlenecks, short-term demand fluctuations, and ad hoc purchasing decisions are inevitable.;3;;;;;
In turn, the company incurs higher time and money costs, penalties for unfulfilled contract terms, excessive inventories, and disruption in purchasing activities, all of which force buyers to spend their time troubleshooting.;0;;;;;
Through contracts that include long-term shipping charters with suppliers in distant countries, the steel industry has secured cost advantages over its chief U.S. and European competitors.;4;;;;;
This reflects a long-term approach to supply security that other chemical companies in the United States and Europe have used to good advantage.;4;;;;;
Cabot Corporation, faced with growing scarcity of chromium, vanadium, niobium, titanium, and other metals critical to its operations, set up a mineral resources division that developed an overall corporate supply strategy and explored new options, ranging from the purchase of ore in the ground to the start-up of joint ventures for primary metal processing.;0;;;;;
They also acquired a London-based trading company to supplement existing purchasing skills with special trading expertise and access to the London metals market.;4;;;;;
To ensure long-term availability of critical materials and components at competitive cost, a host of manufacturers will have to come to grips with the risks and complexities of global sourcing.;4;;;;;
A company that meets annual materials requirements exclusively through long-term contracts may achieve substantial savings through the use of contracts that include a rollover option.;4;;;;;
Long-term agreements, like annual agreements, are done to create an advantage for both supplier and buyer.;4;;;;;
Some companies have all reduced their supply vulnerability through backward integration in response to long-term considerations.;3;;;;;
To what extent might cooperation with suppliers or even competitors strengthen long-term supply relationships or capitalize on shared resources?;4;;;;;
Companies share the production of certain critical car components that they could not produce cost-effectively on their own.;4;;;;;
General is increasingly involving suppliers early in the design process in order to ensure better quality, lower cost, and just in time production.;4;;;;;
Strategic items, natural scarcity, governed by long-term strategic impact. ;4;;;;;
These components are characterized by long-term strategic impacts.;4;;;;;
For strategic items a natural scarcity exists.;4;;;;;
Strategic products are of high profit impact and high supply risk.;4;;;;;
The company may need to support supply decisions of strategic items with analytic techniques, including market analysis, risk analysis, computer simulation and optimization models, price forecasting, and various other kinds of microeconomic analysis.;4;;;;;
Strategic items require intensive analysis to get as much information as possible.;4;;;;;
In many companies over the past few years, raw materials have graduated to strategic.;4;;;;;
Often strategic products are characterized by unique attributes, like quality or performance.;4;;;;;
This is a function of natural scarcity, as in certain strategic metals and minerals, high technological sophistication, or entry barriers in the form of high R&D or facility investments.;4;;;;;
It can then identify areas of opportunity or vulnerability, assess supply risks, and derive basic strategic thrusts for these items.;4;;;;;
Faced with sharp rises in the labor and overhead costs of producing high-precision parts in-house, a Europe-based heavy-equipment maker decided to review its make-or-buy strategy.;0;;;;;
Thanks to low overhead and economies of scale achieved through specialized production, they could supply high-quality parts at prices 10% to 20% below the cost of in-house production.;0;;;;;
In consequence, the company shifted from making the parts to buying them.;0;;;;;
For strategic items where the supplier's strength outweighs the company's and the indicated strategy is diversification, the company should consolidate its supply position by concentrating fragmented purchased volumes in a single supplier, accept high prices, and cover the full volume requirements through supply contracts.;3;;;;;
Purchasing portfolio models have received much attention in the recent literature about professional purchasing.;0;;;;;
One of the most famous portfolio models was introduced.;0;;;;;
His model has had a broad influence on professional purchasing.;0;;;;;
It also inspired many academic writers to undertake further research into portfolio models.;0;;;;;
Other scholars have introduced variations of the original Kraljic matrix.;0;;;;;
The proposed matrices are very similar to the Kraljic matrix in that they employ comparable dimensions, and derive equivalent recommendations.;0;;;;;
Typically, these matrices give only one recommendation for each portfolio quadrant, namely.;0;;;;;
Form partnerships for strategic products.;4;;;;;
Assure supply for bottleneck products.;3;;;;;
Exploit power for leverage products and ensure efficient processing for non-critical products.;2;;;;;
However, a recent study into the actual use of the matrix by professional purchasers pointed out that purchasers make a clear distinction between several strategies within each quadrant.;0;;;;;
Purchasers identify.;0;;;;;
Strategies to hold their position in the quadrant and strategies to move to another position.;0;;;;;
However, the conditions determining the choice for a specific purchasing strategy within a quadrant are yet unclear.;0;;;;;
The fundamental assumption of all portfolio models seems to be the occurrence of differences in power and dependence between buyers and suppliers.;0;;;;;
Kraljic does not explicitly deal with issues of power and dependence.;0;;;;;
However, some of his recommendations obviously refer to the power structure.;0;;;;;
Others are aimed at reducing the dependence on suppliers.;0;;;;;
Moreover, Kraljic stated that the general idea of the portfolio approach is to minimize supply vulnerability and make the most of potential buying power.;0;;;;;
It seems that power and dependence play a significant role in the Kraljic approach.;0;;;;;
The relative power and dependence position of buyers and suppliers are therefore expected to be factors of importance in explaining the conditions that influence the choice of purchasing strategy within each quadrant.;0;;;;;
Until now little is known about the conditions that influence the choice of purchasers to either hold their position in the quadrant or move.;0;;;;;
Moreover, little is known about the way in which power and dependence in buyer-supplier relationships enter the Kraljic matrix.;0;;;;;
Empirical research on the impact of power and dependence on buyer-supplier relationships is even scarcer.;0;;;;;
Therefore, it is critically important to examine the power and dependence positions of buyers and suppliers for the various purchasing strategies that have been identified in each quadrant of the portfolio matrix.;0;;;;;
The goal of this paper is to empirically test several hypotheses that are deduced from the literature on power and dependence.;0;;;;;
This will be done with respect to the purchasing strategies in each quadrant of the Kraljic purchasing portfolio matrix.;0;;;;;
In order to do this we have defined the concepts of power and dependence in terms of buyer s and supplier s dependence.;0;;;;;
Subsequently, we have developed constructs for buyer s dependence as well as supplier s dependence.;0;;;;;
Our empirical analysis is founded on a survey among 250 purchasing professionals.;0;;;;;
On the basis of the survey data we have assessed power and interdependence in buyer-supplier relationships.;0;;;;;
In general terms this study contributes to a better understanding of the power and interdependence in buyer-supplier relationships.;0;;;;;
The organization of the paper is as follows.;0;;;;;
First we will give a brief overview of the Kraljic approach and, on the basis of recent literature, we will identify hypotheses with respect to power and dependence for each strategy used in practice.;0;;;;;
Furthermore, we will operationalize power and dependence into measurable variables and formulate hypotheses.;0;;;;;
In Section 3 we will present our survey design and design constructs for our key variables.;0;;;;;
The results of our survey are presented in Section 4.;0;;;;;
Section 5 will conclude and give suggestions for further research.;0;;;;;
Kraljic advised managers to guard their firms against damaging supply interruptions and to deal with continuous technological change and economics growth.;3;;;;;
In his seminal paper he called attention to the need for companies to attain more effective supply management.;0;;;;;
He proclaimed that purchasing must become supply management.;0;;;;;
In his article he presents a figure in matrix format that classifies the stages of purchasing sophistication within companies.;0;;;;;
The matrix identifies four stages purchasing management.;0;;;;;
Materials management.;0;;;;;
Sourcing management.;0;;;;;
Supply management.;0;;;;;
Kraljic argues that supply management is particularly relevant in the case that the supply market is complex and the importance of purchasing is high.;0;;;;;
In the second part of his article Kraljic proposes a four-stage approach as a framework for developing supply strategies for single products or product groups.;0;;;;;
The company weighs the bargaining power of its suppliers against its own power.;0;;;;;
The company positions the products that were identified as strategic, often with high profit impact and high supply risk.;4;;;;;
It develops purchasing strategies and action plans for these strategic products, depending on its own strength and the strength of the supply market.;0;;;;;
Three general purchasing strategies are recommended.;0;;;;;
Exploit the power position, if there is buyer dominance.;2;;;;;
In a strategic partnership the powers are balanced.;4;;;;;
Purchasers should diversify in case of supplier dominance.;3;;;;;
It should be noted that Kraljic focuses on strategic products, for the other item categories Kraljic merely formulated a number ofmain tasks.;0;;;;;
Other scholars have filled this gap.;0;;;;;
They have formulated strategic recommendations, resulting in an overall purchasing strategy recommendation for each portfolio quadrant.;0;;;;;
This matrix is commonly referred to as Kraljic s portfolio matrix.;0;;;;;
With the help of this matrix, professional purchasers can differentiate between the various supplier relations and choose strategies that are appropriate for each category and thereby effectively manage suppliers.;0;;;;;
A recent study by Gelderman and Van Weele paid attention to the experience of purchasing professionals with the use of the portfolio matrix in practice.;0;;;;;
On the basis of three in-depth case studies they found that practitioners distinguish between several separate purchasing strategies within each portfolio quadrant.;0;;;;;
Some of these strategies focused on keeping the current position in the quadrant, while other strategies were directed towards moving to another position.;0;;;;;
It gives an overview of strategic directions for all categories.;0;;;;;
While Gelderman and Van Weele showed that several strategies per quadrant occur in practice, the conditions determining the choice for a specific purchasing strategy remained an issue for further research.;0;;;;;
In the literature on buyer-supplier relationships it is generally acknowledged that power and interdependence issues are fundamental to the way in which buyers and suppliers interact.;0;;;;;
It is reasonable to assume that power and dependence issues will also underpin the choice for a specific purchasing strategy.;0;;;;;
Each purchasing strategy identified by Gelderman and Van Weele gives rise to hypotheses on the importance of power and dependence.;0;;;;;
We will revisit the strategies and connect them to the power and interdependence balance.;0;;;;;
Firms always depend, to varying extents, on their trading partner.;0;;;;;
Early studies on dependence focused on the effects for the buyer of its dependence on the supplier, without taking into account the supplier s dependence.;0;;;;;
More recent studies have incorporated dependence from the perspective of the buyer as well as the supplier.;0;;;;;
In other words, dependence is mutual.;0;;;;;
Mutual dependence and power are closely related concepts.;0;;;;;
The buyer s dependence on the supplier is a source of power for the supplier, and vice versa.;0;;;;;
A well-known definition is that the relative power of an organization over another is the result of the net dependence of the one on the other.;0;;;;;
If A depends on B more than B depends on A, then B has power over A.;0;;;;;
They define relative power as the dependence of one party compared to the dependence of the other party.;0;;;;;
Anderson use the term relative dependence to refer to the difference between a firm s dependence on its partner and its partner s dependence on the firm.;0;;;;;
The primary consequence of relative dependence is indicated as power.;0;;;;;
Buchanan conceptualized power-dependence imbalances in buyer-supplier relationships as the difference in value that buyers and sellers attach to the relationship.;0;;;;;
In asymmetric relationships, the most independent partner dominates the exchange.;0;;;;;
Balanced relationships refer to domination of neither party.;0;;;;;
They use the term interdependence asymmetry, which is defined as the difference between the two partner s levels of dependence.;0;;;;;
Symmetrical interdependence exists when parties are equally dependent on each other.;0;;;;;
Buyer-supplier relationships that are characterized by asymmetric interdependence are more dysfunctional because the independent partner experiences high power and will be attempted to exploit.;0;;;;;
In the long term the position of the weaker party will be eroded too much and the partnership will be destroyed.;2;;;;;
Anderson and Weitz point out that imbalanced channel relationships are characterized by less cooperation and greater conflict.;0;;;;;
Various researchers have argued that a comprehensive view of the interdependence of a dyadic relationship should include not only interdependence asymmetry (or relative power), but also total interdependence or total power.;0;;;;;
Total interdependence refers to the intensity of a relationship.;0;;;;;
A high level of total interdependence is an indicator for a strong, co-operative long-term relationship in which both parties have invested.;4;;;;;
Mutual trust and mutual commitment will characterize those relationships.;4;;;;;
Both partners are commited to contributing to the success;4;;;;;
Besides this loyalty towards the other partner and the accompanying desire to continue the relationship, there is an alternative motivation for both firms to keep the partnership intact.;4;;;;;
In the case that both parties know that the other party possesses much power, it is not likely that either side is going to use it.;4;;;;;
The risk of retaliation is often considered as being too high.;4;;;;;
When total interdependence is high, both partners are faced with high exit barriers.;4;;;;;
From the above it can be concluded that the literature makes a clear difference between the concepts of relative power, which is the result of interdependence asymmetry.;0;;;;;
And total power, which is the result of full interdependence of both parties on each other and which is commonly referred to as total interdependence.;4;;;;;
However, empirical research on the impact of relative power and total interdependence on buyer-supplier relationships is scarce.;0;;;;;
To be able to fill this void, we have defined both concepts in terms of buyer s and supplier s dependence.;0;;;;;
In this study, we will measure the buyer s relative power as the difference between supplier s dependence and buyer s dependence.;0;;;;;
Similarly, we will measure the supplier s relative power as the difference between buyer s dependence and supplier s dependence.;0;;;;;
This is to conform Pfeffer s viewpoint that the relative power of one social actor over another is the result of the net dependence of the one on the other.;0;;;;;
In accordance with Bacharach and Lawler, we will measure total interdependence in a relationship by the sum of the parties  dependence on one another.;0;;;;;
We will develop hypotheses on the power-dependence balance for each purchasing strategy identified by Gelderman and Van Weele.;0;;;;;
These products represent a considerable value to the organization in terms of a large impact on profit and a high supply risk.;4;;;;;
Examples are engines and gearboxes for automobile manufacturers, turbines for the chemical industry and bottling equipment for breweries.;0;;;;;
Often strategic products can only be purchased from one supplier, causing a significant supply risk.;4;;;;;
The general recommendation for supplier management in this quadrant is to maintain a strategic partnership.;4;;;;;
Purchasing practitioners employ two additional purchasing strategies in this quadrant, namely accept a locked-in partnership.;4;;;;;
Maintain strategic partnership means extending the current collaboration.;4;;;;;
In order to counterbalance the supply risk, firms will aim at building a partnership relationship with its supplier.;4;;;;;
The mutual trust and commitment that is associated with an intensified relationship is likely to reduce the supply risk to a minimum.;4;;;;;
A close and lasting co-operation with suppliers will lead to improvements in product quality, delivery reliability, lead times, product development, product design, and it will result in cost reduction.;4;;;;;
This situation can be characterized as one with balanced power.;0;;;;;
Buyers and suppliers are both heavily involved in the partnership, therefore mutual dependence is expected to be high.;4;;;;;
Total interdependence is high as well, since the relationship is very intense.;4;;;;;
Accept a locked-in partnership.;4;;;;;
This strategy often occurs when the buyer is subject to unfavourable conditions of the supplier and is unable to pull out of the situation.;3;;;;;
The locked in position might be caused by the fact that the supplier holds the patent to a certain product and therefore has monopoly power to some extent.;3;;;;;
Supplier monopolies often lead to supply bottlenecks.;3;;;;;
This situation can be characterized as one dominated by the supplier.;3;;;;;
This strategy is employed when a supplier s performance has become unacceptable and incorrigible.;0;;;;;
The buyer will try to reduce his dependence on the supplier.;3;;;;;
One way of achieving this is to search for alternative suppliers.;3;;;;;
In this situation the buyer still depends on the supplier, so we expect to find supplier dominance.;3;;;;;
The involvement of both parties in the relationship is expected to be the lowest in this situation compared to the ones described above, leading to the lowest total interdependence for this scenario.;0;;;;;
Supply risk is usually high in these scenarios.;3;;;;;
These products have a moderate influence on the financial results of a firm, but they are vulnerable with regard to their supply.;3;;;;;
Suppliers have a dominant power position for these products.;3;;;;;
The purchasing strategy that is commonly recommended for these products is primarily based on acceptance of the dependence and reduction of the negative effects of the unfavourable position.;3;;;;;
An alternative strategy suggested by purchasing practitioners is to find other suppliers and move towards the non-critical quadrant.;3;;;;;
Buyers should accept dependence and reduce negative consequences.;3;;;;;
Often assuring supply means accepting additional costs.;3;;;;;
The main focus of this strategy is to assure supply, if necessary even at additional cost.;3;;;;;
Keeping extra stocks of the materials concerned or developing consigned stock agreements with suppliers.;3;;;;;
By performing a risk analysis firms can identify the most important bottleneck products and consider the implications.;3;;;;;
A possible action for dealing with unexpected bad dependence positions for certain products is to employ contingency planning.;3;;;;;
Reduce dependence and risk, find other solution.;3;;;;;
This strategy is geared towards reducing the dependence on the supplier.;3;;;;;
The most common way to achieve this is to broaden the specifications of the product or to search for new suppliers.;3;;;;;
We expect the supplier dominance to be the highest in the case that the buyer accepts the dependence position.;3;;;;;
The buyer searches for ways out of the current situation, and for this to be possible we expect the supplier dominance to be less fierce.;3;;;;;
Total interdependence is expected to be high, since buyers are not very involved in the relationship when they are searching for alternative suppliers.;3;;;;;
Supply is easily attainable from different suppliers.;2;;;;;
Leverage products can be obtained from various suppliers.;2;;;;;
These products represent a relatively large share of the end product cost price in combination with a relatively low supply risk.;2;;;;;
The buyer has many possibilities and incentives for negotiation, since small percentages of cost savings usually involve large sums of money.;2;;;;;
At the same time the supply risk is minimal.;2;;;;;
These characteristics justify an aggressive approach to the supply market.;2;;;;;
A purchasing strategy directed towards exploitation of the buying power is pursued.;2;;;;;
Practitioners also identify an additional strategy in this quadrant, which is intended to change the current situation.;0;;;;;
Developing a strategic partnership brings most value to both parties.;4;;;;;
Powerful buyers exploit buying power.;2;;;;;
In this strategy the firm pursues competitive bidding.;2;;;;;
Suppliers and products are interchangeable.;2;;;;;
A coordinated purchasing approach is adopted that has the form of a centrally negotiated umbrella agreement with preferred suppliers.;2;;;;;
Call-off orders are then placed as an administrative formality.;2;;;;;
The buying power is actively used to get better deals with interchangeable suppliers.;2;;;;;
This scenario is therefore characterized by buyer dominance.;2;;;;;
Practioners choose to opt for a strategic partnership with a supplier.;4;;;;;
This cooperative strategy is only pursued when the supplier is willing and able to contribute to the competitive advantage of the buyer s firm.;4;;;;;
Hence, this role is only attainable for technologically advanced suppliers.;0;;;;;
In this scenario we expect to find a balanced power position between the buyer and supplier.;0;;;;;
Total interdependence is expected to be highe, since buyers and suppliers become increasingly involved in the relationship when a strategic partnership is built.;4;;;;;
Table gives an overview of our expectations for the power balance and the level of total interdependence in each of the identified strategies.;0;;;;;
These products usually have a small value per unit.;1;;;;;
Many alternative suppliers can be found.;1;;;;;
From a purchasing point of view, these items cause only few technical or commercial problems.;1;;;;;
As a rule of thumb routine products require 80% of the purchasing department s time, while they often represent less than 20% of the purchasing turnover.;0;;;;;
In general, in this situation purchasers are advised to pool purchasing requirements.;1;;;;;
In addition they identify the strategy of individual ordering and pursue of efficient processing.;1;;;;;
Pool purchasing requirements: The handling of non-critical products requires a purchasing strategy aimed at reducing the logistic and administrative complexity.;1;;;;;
Reduce complexity of noncritical items.;1;;;;;
Systems contracting is generally advised as the way of doing business with suppliers of routine products.;1;;;;;
The main idea is to enhance purchasing power by standardization and bundling of purchasing requirements.;1;;;;;
The products are ordered individually and processed efficiently.;1;;;;;
Whenever it is not possible to pool the purchasing requirements, professional purchasers adopt some kind of individual ordering, for instance by means of a purchase card.;1;;;;;
This strategy is aimed at reducing the indirect purchasing costs that are associated with administrative activities, such as ordering and invoicing.;1;;;;;
There is a low dependence between buyer and supplier.;1;;;;;
The routine character of the transaction implies that the relative power position between both parties is balanced.;1;;;;;
Total interdependence is expected to be lowest.;1;;;;;
Table gives an overview of our expectations for the power balance and the level of total interdependence in each of the identified strategies.;0;;;;;
The survey adopts a repeated measures design, respondents had to evaluate a series of identical questions for each scenario.;0;;;;;
The questions refer to buyer s dependence and supplier s dependence.;0;;;;;
Below we discuss how constructs were developed for these two variables.;0;;;;;
The distinct advantage of using a repeated measures design instead of other experimental designs is that the potential bias caused by individual differences among groups of respondents is taken away.;0;;;;;
Each of the respondents has to answer all questions in each scenario.;0;;;;;
Therefore, specific characteristics of the respondents, such as IQ, education and motivation, do not differ across the four groups that reply to the questions in each scenario.;0;;;;;
In sum, by adopting a repeated measures design, variability among groups of respondents is removed from the error term, which makes the design more powerful than randomized designs.;0;;;;;
A potential drawback of the adopted research method is that respondents might not be able to fully visualize themselves in the proposed descriptions, resulting in unreliable answers.;0;;;;;
We countered this shortcoming by including an entry for recognition of the scenario, i.e.;0;;;;;
respondents were asked to assess the degree in which they recognize the described situation.;0;;;;;
In the analysis of the data, we removed the survey results for respondents with low scores on Ôrecognition  from the database.;0;;;;;
In this way we ensured the validity of our results.;0;;;;;
The survey procedure included a pilot study aimed at enhancing the reliability and the validity of the questionnaire.;0;;;;;
The pilot study entailed discussions with six purchasing professionals in four Dutch firms.;0;;;;;
Several issues were discussed during these interviews, such as the clarity of the questionnaire items, the recognizability of the scenarios, the time needed to fill in the questionnaire and issues for further improvement of the items.;0;;;;;
On account of the pilot study several improvements have been made in the description and layout of the questionnaire items, response options and scenarios.;0;;;;;
The final questionnaire has been administered to 1153 members of the Dutch Association of Purchasing Management in three rounds.;0;;;;;
We specifically targeted these purchasing professionals, because of their vast experience, expertise and insight into the development of supplier relationships.;0;;;;;
A total number of 248 responses were received, resulting in a response rate of 21.5%.;0;;;;;
Questionnaires that were completed for less than 90% were declared invalid.;0;;;;;
Hence, a total of 10 reactions were discarded due to incomplete information.;0;;;;;
In addition, all responses were removed that scored on average less than 3 for recognition on a 5-point Likert scale.;0;;;;;
In this way, another 22 responses were omitted, resulting in an effective response rate of 18.7%.;0;;;;;
The likelihood of a non-response bias was investigated using the procedure recommended.;0;;;;;
They state that it is safe to assume that late respondents are similar to non-respondents in many respects.;0;;;;;
One should always compare the results of the first category of returned questionnaires  to the results of the second category of returned questionnaires.;0;;;;;
All our tests indicated that no statistical significant differences were found between the first wave and the second wave of respondents.;0;;;;;
Therefore, we conclude that our study does not suffer from a non-response bias.;0;;;;;
Many studies discuss different aspects of organizational dependence.;0;;;;;
Jacobs introduces two concepts from economic theory to describe dependence, namely essentiality and substitutability.;0;;;;;
He points out that it is of primary importance to the concept of dependence whether A can do without B or whether other sources are available.;0;;;;;
Scholars in Resource Dependence Theory refer to essentiality as the importance of a resource, which is said to be determined by.;0;;;;;
the relative financial magnitude of the resource.;0;;;;;
The criticality of the resource.;0;;;;;
Substitutability can be subdivided in the availability of alternative sources and the level of relation specific investments.;1;;;;;
the costs involved with switching between suppliers.;0;;;;;
With these characteristics in mind we have set up constructs for buyer s dependence and supplier s dependence as follows.;0;;;;;
It is reasonable to assume that the first aspect of organizational dependence, the relative financial magnitude of transactions, particularly impacts on supplier s dependence.;0;;;;;
When a lot of money is involved the buyer has a powerful position in negotiations.;2;;;;;
Factors such as the availability of alternative suppliers and low switching costs between suppliers are much more important to the buyer than the relative amount of money that is involved.;2;;;;;
Therefore, we have excluded financial magnitude from our construct of buyer s dependence and included it in our supplier s dependence construct.;0;;;;;
There is a difference in the perspective of buyers and suppliers with regard to the second component of dependence as well.;0;;;;;
The criticality of a resource refers to the degree in which the organization is able to continue its business processes in the absence of the resource.;3;;;;;
In essence, however, the concept is two-fold in nature.;0;;;;;
On the one hand it refers to a need for technological expertise of the partner, on the other hand it points to issues of logistical indispensability.;0;;;;;
The need for technological expertise is critical for both parties, buyer and supplier.;0;;;;;
In an industrial context, companies rely more and more on technologically advanced key suppliers.;0;;;;;
From the supplier s perspective a similar argument holds.;0;;;;;
Companies increasingly need the critical expertise and specialized knowledge of their industrial customers.;0;;;;;
Logistics-based dependence, on the other hand, is less an issue to the supplier than it is to the buyer.;0;;;;;
This unilateral dependence on the part of the buyer is explained in transaction cost theory by the concept of asset specificity.;0;;;;;
The buyer is chiefly interested in receiving the goods in a way that is logistically compatible with its own production system.;0;;;;;
The supplier will deliver the goods in any logistic way that is required, as long as the buyer will pay for it.;0;;;;;
The buyer s main concern is the correct delivery of the goods, which makes the buyer dependent on the specific assets of a certain supplier.;0;;;;;
The supplier s main concern is only of a financial nature.;0;;;;;
On the basis of these considerations we have redefined the concept of resource criticality in the construct of supplier s dependence to solely include the need for the buyer s technological expertise.;0;;;;;
The construct for buyer s dependence includes the logistical indispensability of the supplier, in addition to the need for a supplier s technological expertise.;0;;;;;
With respect to the high availability of alternative sources and low switching costs the dependence positions of buyers and suppliers are symmetrical.;1;;;;;
The buyer depends as much on the supplier as the other way around.;0;;;;;
Both buying and supplying organizations invest in the relationship with their trading partner.;4;;;;;
When the supplier develops and uses dedicated equipment assigned exclusively to one customer this will result in high switching costs if the relationship deteriorates.;4;;;;;
On the other hand, buying organizations also face relation specific investments, making significant investments in suppliers.;4;;;;;
For obvious reasons the overall dependency on the other party is also included in both variables, the construct of buyer dependence and the construct of supplier dependence.;4;;;;;
Table summarizes the components of each of the three main characteristics of buyer-supplier relationships that we have identified in this section.;0;;;;;
A reliability analysis using Cronbach s alpha was performed to ensure the internal consistency of the indicators that constitute each construct.;0;;;;;
In Table we present the results of our reliability analysis.;0;;;;;
The table shows the values of Cronbach s alpha for each purchasing strategy in the Kraljic matrix.;0;;;;;
The coefficients of Cronbach s alpha are all higher than 0.60, indicating an acceptable internal consistency and reliability of the constructs.;0;;;;;
An evaluation of the nature of buyer-supplier relationships includes the assessment of net dependence, which corresponds to the relative power of each party and total interdependence, which refers to the intensity of the relationship between parties.;0;;;;;
It shows the average score for buyer s dependence and supplier s dependence in the nine scenarios.;0;;;;;
It presents the resulting findings for the relative power position of the buyer, the difference between buyer s dependence and supplier s dependence.;0;;;;;
A positive sign for the power balance shows that the supplier dominates the relationship, whereas a negative sign points to buyer dominance.;0;;;;;
Total interdependence is depicted in the last column in Table and is measured by the sum of buyer s dependence and supplier s dependence.;0;;;;;
On a scale that runs from +2 (minimal interdependence) to +10 (maximal interdependence) we consider values below 5 as low, between 5 and 7 as moderate and above 7 as high.;0;;;;;
Note that the repeated measure design of the survey was accounted for when analysing the data.;0;;;;;
Buyer-supplier relationships in the bottleneck quadrant are also dominated by the supplier.;3;;;;;
With respect to the leverage quadrant the hypotheses for both scenarios are confirmed as well.;2;;;;;
We find buyer dominance when buyers decide to exploit their buying power.;2;;;;;
The insignificant difference between supplier dependence and buyer dependence in the situation that parties try to form a partnership points to a situation of balanced power.;4;;;;;
Both strategies in the non-critical quadrant are characterized by a significant power balance.;1;;;;;
The findings confirm all hypotheses on basis on the existing literature on buyer-supplier relationships.;0;;;;;
Except for the expectation of power balance in the case that a strategic partnership is maintained.;4;;;;;
The literature characterizes this kind of buyer-supplier relationships as satisfactory relationships based on trust, commitment and open communication.;4;;;;;
In contrast, the findings suggest that such satisfactory relationships experience an asymmetric power balance.;0;;;;;
From the buyer perspective the supplier dominates the relationship.;3;;;;;
Once a buyer has entered a partnership this ensures a disproportionate raise in the dependence of the buyer on the supplying partner.;4;;;;;
He gives a possible explanation for this phenomenon.;0;;;;;
In their belief a pre-contractual situation of balanced power shifts to a post-contractual situation of supplier dominance, when the supplier refuses to offer balance in the relationship and locks the buyer in.;4;;;;;
Our results therefore empirically confirm the belief of Cox et al.;0;;;;;
Our findings can also be explained by the notion of Frazier and Antia, that unbalanced relationships may not always be troublesome.;0;;;;;
A known distribution of power between both partners could provide effective co-ordination of the exchange relationship.;0;;;;;
In this case the relative power position is used to enhance the nature of relational exchange between trading partners.;0;;;;;
The distribution of power has become legitimated over time as both parties know what to expect from each other.;0;;;;;
Gelderman and Van Weele found that purchasing professionals adhere to two kinds of purchasing strategies in each quadrant.;0;;;;;
One type of strategy pursues preservation of the current position in the quadrant, while the other type pursues a move to another position.;0;;;;;
The relative power position of buyers and suppliers is expected to influence the choice of purchasing strategy within each quadrant.;0;;;;;
Therefore, the question is whether significant differences exist in the relative power position between the strategies that are pursued within each quadrant.;0;;;;;
Table presents the difference between purchasing strategies within each quadrant.;0;;;;;
POWER refers to the relative power position for the buyer in scenario i.;0;;;;;
A negative sign shows that supplier dominance in the first scenario is lower than in the second scenario.;0;;;;;
All differences in the power situation between quadrants turn out to be significant.;0;;;;;
This indicates that each purchasing strategy is characterized by a unique power balance between buyers and suppliers.;0;;;;;
The findings in Table confirm our prior expectations.;0;;;;;
For a critical item we find the highest level of supplier dominance when the buyer accepts the locked-in relationship.;3;;;;;
The highest level of commitment and dependence is found in the situation that a strategic partnership is maintained.;4;;;;;
These results confirm hypotheses.;0;;;;;
In a bottleneck the strategy in which the dependence position is accepted and the negative consequences are reduced by keeping safety stocks is associated with the highest supplier domination.;3;;;;;
With respect to the strategies within the leverage quadrant, we find a better power position for the buyer, a lower supplier dominance, when the buying power is exploited.;2;;;;;
The development of a strategic partnership means deterioration of the power position of the buyer.;4;;;;;
Furthermore, the results indicate a better power position for the buyer when purchasing requirements are pooled, than in the case that individual orders are placed.;1;;;;;
The last column of Table shows the level of total interdependence associated with the various purchasing strategies.;0;;;;;
Several separate tests have been undertaken to determine whether total interdependence differs significantly between individual purchasing strategies within each quadrant.;0;;;;;
The results in Table confirm our expectations.;0;;;;;
Within the strategic quadrant total interdependence is highest when the strategic partnership is maintained.;4;;;;;
In the bottleneck quadrant the highest level of interdependence is associated with an acceptance of the dependence position.;3;;;;;
With respect to the strategies within the leverage quadrant, we find a lower supplier power.;2;;;;;
The findings suggest that total interdependence is highest when a strategic partnership is developed.;4;;;;;
For the non-critical quadrant the highest level of interdependence is associated with the strategy in which purchasing requirements are pooled.;1;;;;;
The difference between the two strategies is not significant.;0;;;;;
This suggests that both strategies can be associated with a similar level of interdependence.;0;;;;;
In general, we conclude that our empirical findings confirm the hitherto untested theoretical notions about total interdependence in buyer-supplier relationships.;0;;;;;
Kraljic s approach has inspired many academics to undertake further research into purchasing portfolio models.;0;;;;;
Refined models typically recommended one purchasing strategy for each portfolio quadrant.;0;;;;;
They found that professional purchasers make a clear distinction between alternative strategies within each quadrant.;0;;;;;
The conditions determining the choice for a specific purchasing strategy within a quadrant remain yet unclear, but might very well be associated with differences in power and dependence positions.;0;;;;;
In this paper, we have empirically quantified the concepts of relative power and total interdependence for each purchasing strategy, using data from a comprehensive survey among Dutch purchasing professionals.;0;;;;;
This study builds on the case studies of Gelderman and Van Weele by adding further insights into the power and interdependence structure of the various portfolio-based purchasing strategies.;0;;;;;
The results of our study prove that there is a significant difference in the power positions between the purchasing strategies within each quadrant.;0;;;;;
Figure summarizes the results, showing the relative power positions that are associated with each purchasing strategy.;0;;;;;
Note that the diagonal line indicates positions in which buyer s dependence is equal to supplier s dependence, it indicates power balance.;0;;;;;
Strategies on the left-hand side of the diagonal line are characterized by buyer dominance, while strategies on the right-hand side are characterized by supplier dominance.;0;;;;;
The length of the perpendicular line from each data point towards the diagonal line indicates the size of the power difference between buyers and suppliers.;0;;;;;
Comparing strategies aimed at moving towards other positions in the Kraljic matrix with strategies aimed at maintaining the current position leads to the following conclusions.;0;;;;;
The strategies in the strategic and the bottleneck quadrant which are aimed at moving imply a reduction of the supply risk.;3;;;;;
Their positions in indicate that these strategies are pursued in the case that buyer s dependence is relatively low.;0;;;;;
The level of supplier s dependence seems to be less critical to the choice for these strategies.;0;;;;;
Buyers usually prefer a strategy aimed at maintaining their position in the leverage quadrant of the Kraljic matrix.;2;;;;;
Our findings suggest that relatively high levels of both buyer and supplier dependence constitute conditions for engaging in a partnership and thereby follow a strategy aimed at moving to another quadrant.;0;;;;;
Finally, no significant differences were found between scenarios 8 and 9 in the non-critical quadrant.;1;;;;;
Hence, the levels of buyer s and supplier s dependence do not seem to influence the choice for changing or maintaining the position in this quadrant.;0;;;;;
Note that the differences of purchasing strategies in the power map within each Kraljic quadrant are smaller than the differences between the quadrants.;0;;;;;
For instance, the strategies in the non-critical quadrant are located closely together in the power map, while the other strategies are at a relatively large distance.;1;;;;;
Therefore, we can conclude that the levels of buyer s and supplier s dependence largely determine the position of a purchasing strategy within the Kraljic matrix.;0;;;;;
A conclusion is that positions in the bottleneck quadrant of the matrix are associated with buyer-supplier relationships, which are characterized by supplier dominance.;3;;;;;
Positions in the non-critical quadrant are perceived to be of a more power-balanced nature.;1;;;;;
A comparison between our empirical findings and the theoretical expectations generate the following conclusions.;0;;;;;
All hypotheses regarding the power balance associated with each purchasing strategy within the quadrants were confirmed.;0;;;;;
This provocative result sheds new light on the buyer s view on issues of power and dependence.;0;;;;;
It indicates that a relationship which is characterized by a high involvement of buyers and suppliers does not necessarily imply a balanced power position between the parties, but can yet be satisfactory, at least from the point of view of the buyer.;0;;;;;
All hypotheses concerning the relative power positions of the different strategies within each quadrant and the level of total interdependence were confirmed.;0;;;;;
Despite the rigor of our analysis, our study contains several limitations that might entice further research.;0;;;;;
One of the limitations concerns the sample, which was drawn from a list of members of the Dutch Association of Purchasing Management.;0;;;;;
Although our sample included a wide range of industry sectors, the generalizability of the results would benefit from the inclusion of firms in the service sector, as well as other Dutch and international companies.;0;;;;;
This might be the object of a further study.;0;;;;;
Another limitation concerns the fact that the survey was confined to the perspective of the buyer.;0;;;;;
Yet, buyer-supplier relationships are dyadic in nature.;0;;;;;
Suppliers might have different opinions on the power and interdependence structure of the various buyer-supplier relationships.;0;;;;;
Therefore, there is a need to more fully study the supplier s perspective in order to establish whether or not both parties perceive each other s power position in the relationship in the same way.;0;;;;;
In addition, further research should take a more holistic supply chain perspective on buyer-supplier relationships and acknowledge the possible influence of critical external forces, such as regulation, standards and international trade barriers.;0;;;;;
Compelling evidence indicates that strategic management of supply markets can provide competitive advantage.;0;;;;;
However, in an effort to improve performance, not all purchased materials and buyer-supplier relationships should be managed the same way.;0;;;;;
This suggests that professional purchasing requires differentiation and some sort of classification of these resources.;0;;;;;
Consequently, many portfolio models have been developed, some of which are widely adopted in practice to manage different types of materials or buyer-supplier relationships.;0;;;;;
One of the most commonly used approaches is the Kraljic matrix, which distinguishes non-critical, leverage, bottleneck and strategic purchases along two dimensions: strategic importance and supply risk.;0;;;;;
For each portfolio quadrant, this matrix offers the buying firms corresponding generic strategic recommendations and tactics.;0;;;;;
The traditional, prescriptive view of the Kraljic matrix is intuitively appealing, as it allows purchases to be classified into four quadrants.;0;;;;;
This in turn enables purchasers to implement the quadrant-specific strategic recommendations and tactical sourcing levers in order to maximize performance.;0;;;;;
Failure to achieve the right outcomes indicates either a failure of the tool or a failure of the user.;0;;;;;
In practice, strategy implementation is often not that simple.;0;;;;;
Recommendations made by management tools, such as the Kraljic matrix, may not be seen as prescriptions but as starting points for structured discussion between different actors.;0;;;;;
In-depth discussions on the positions in the Kraljic matrix are considered as the most important phase of the analysis.;0;;;;;
Therefore, over a decade ago, authors of several studies called for moving away from advocating a strict adherence to the deterministic recommendations of the Kraljic Matrix, noting that not all purchased items in the same portfolio quadrant are to be managed in one generic way.;0;;;;;
Rather, experience shows that practitioners also pick tactical sourcing levers from adjacent quadrants that will allow them to move from a current difficult to a future much easier quadrant or power scenario.;0;;;;;
It has been hypothesized that sourcing practice demands that many, if not all, tactical sourcing levers may be used in each of the four quadrants.;0;;;;;
Surprisingly, research on purchasing portfolio models contributes little to verify how tactical sourcing levers are actually applied in practice.;0;;;;;
Prior works contrasted portfolio quadrants by differences in product characteristics, purchasing skills, buyer-supplier, power structures and organizational.;0;;;;;
Still, little is known about the actual use of portfolio models in purchasing.;0;;;;;
There is evident paucity of empirical investigations on tactical sourcing levers that can be employed in each portfolio quadrant to achieve performance targets.;0;;;;;
The move from theoretical consideration to empirical reality is still missing.;0;;;;;
Consequently, the aim of this study is to investigate if tactical sourcing levers are really applied according to the generic suggestions made by purchasing portfolio models.;0;;;;;
To do so, the study is guided by the following research question: Does the application of tactical sourcing levers vary according to strategic importance and supply?;0;;;;;
To answer this question, a detailed review of extant literature about purchasing portfolio models and tactical sourcing levers was first conducted.;0;;;;;
A measurement instrument for supply risk, strategic importance and tactical sourcing levers was developed and applied to sourcing projects including a wide range of direct purchases.;0;;;;;
Each sourcing project was later classified into the non-critical, leverage, bottleneck or strategic quadrant of the Kraljic matrix.;0;;;;;
Finally, sourcing lever profiles for each portfolio quadrant were contrasted with the help of non-parametric tests.;0;;;;;
Tactics are used to particularize overall strategic approaches when transitioning from general strategy to ultimate activities.;0;;;;;
Unfortunately, literature often confusingly uses the term purchasing strategies to describe strategic as well as tactical approaches.;0;;;;;
To avoid confusion, this study uses the terms purchasing strategy to describe strategic approaches related to the overall purchasing department and tactical sourcing levers to describe sets of tactics used to operationalize strategy as a combination of activities in a sourcing category.;0;;;;;
Thereby, a sourcing category includes materials or services of a similar type which constitute a single supply market.;0;;;;;
In contrast to purchasing strategy, tactical sourcing levers do not provide a general orientation for purchasing activities such as achieving annual cost saving targets or fostering innovation.;0;;;;;
Tactical sourcing levers describe a typology of activities through which the goals shall be realized.;0;;;;;
Often with a concrete time specification and traceable milestones.;0;;;;;
A major strength of this study lies in the research design, which directly integrates front-line purchasing agents and their experience in the application of tactical sourcing levers.;0;;;;;
The study has important implications: In a traditional view, each quadrant of the Kraljic matrix requires specific, generic tactics.;0;;;;;
Thereby, most recommendations are limited exclusively to a single portfolio quadrant.;0;;;;;
From such publications, it might be assumed, for example, that only non-critical purchases require efficient processing.;1;;;;;
However, the findings yielded by this study support a more differentiated approach to that suggested in previous works.;0;;;;;
A mix chosen from the entire range of tactical sourcing levers has been found to be used in each portfolio quadrant.;0;;;;;
As strategic importance increases and supply risk reduces, tactical sourcing levers are more extensively used.;2;;;;;
Tactical sourcing levers are applied additively, rather than exclusively.;0;;;;;
This suggests rethinking the task applying the usage of the Kraljic matrix and management tools in general.;0;;;;;
Rather than providing mutually exclusive prescriptions to choosing the right strategic and tactical approaches, the Kraljic matrix may more usefully conceptualized as a space for debate and dialogue to bring together actors with different viewpoints in a way that strategic choices can be made.;0;;;;;
The discussion and analysis of the aforementioned issues commences, providing an overview of relevant literature about purchasing portfolios and tactical sourcing levers.;0;;;;;
The survey design and measurement models are presented.;0;;;;;
The resulting sourcing lever profiles for each portfolio quadrant are contrasted and discussed.;0;;;;;
Implications and suggestions for further research are presented.;0;;;;;
Kraljic adopted the portfolio concept to the purchasing context offering pragmatic advice on how top management can recognize the extent of its own supply weakness and treat it with a comprehensive strategy to manage supply.;0;;;;;
The Kraljic matrix classifies purchased items along the dimensions of strategic importance and supply risk.;0;;;;;
The outcome is a 2x2 matrix, known as the Kraljic matrix, which provides a classification into four portfolio quadrants.;0;;;;;
Non-critical items make up a big share of purchasing items.;1;;;;;
Leverage purchases are characterized by high buyer power.;2;;;;;
In Bottleneck scenarios there is a high supply risk.;3;;;;;
Strategic Partnerships involve both buyer and supplier in joint actions.;4;;;;;
In his original publications, Kraljic recommends specific tactics for each single portfolio quadrant.;0;;;;;
Many alternative suppliers are available for buyers.;1;;;;;
Non-critical purchases are of low strategic importance and ordered frequently from many alternative sources.;1;;;;;
Thus, pertinent tactics focus on reducing transaction costs through product standardization, order volume optimization, efficient processing and inventory optimization.;1;;;;;
Leverage purchases include high volume expenditures in a large marketplace with many alternative suppliers.;2;;;;;
This diversity allows exploitation of full purchasing power, vendor selection, product substitution, targeted pricing negotiations, a mix between contract and spot purchasing and order volume optimization.;2;;;;;
Bottleneck purchases have a low strategic importance and are only available from a small number of sources.;3;;;;;
The tactics that are relevant in this case focus on volume insurance, control of vendors, security of inventories and backup plans.;3;;;;;
Strategic items include essential compenents.;4;;;;;
Strategic purchases are critical for profitability and operations and can be obtained from a limited number of qualified sources.;4;;;;;
They require accurate demand forecasting, detailed market research, development of long-term supply relationships, make-or-buy decisions, contract staggering, risk analysis, contingency planning as well as logistics, inventory and vendor control.;4;;;;;
Over time, several authors have refined the analytical variables on the axes of the Kraljic matrix and added or changed recommendations for the portfolio quadrants.;0;;;;;
Still, the practical application of the Kraljic Matrix exceeds and sometimes contradicts its theoretical use.;0;;;;;
Existing publications create the impression that specific tactical sourcing levers are limited to a single portfolio quadrant.;0;;;;;
For example, Monczka and Handfield list distinct essential tactics in each quadrant of a portfolio matrix.;0;;;;;
Each element is attributed to a single quadrant exclusively.;0;;;;;
Lysons and Farrington list 32 aims and main tasks but only three of these items are named in more than one quadrant.;0;;;;;
Johnson recognize that firms may aim to move products into another quadrant but still list exclusive tactics for each quadrant.;0;;;;;
However, other authors report that most tactical sourcing levers may be used in multiple if not all quadrants of the Kraljic Matrix.;0;;;;;
For example, Cox argue that the original Kraljic matrix fails to recognize tactics aiming to change a purchase's position in the portfolio matrix (dynamic leverage).;0;;;;;
Motivated by moving certain purchased items from one quadrant to another, purchasing agents were found to adopt tactical sourcing levers which, in Kraljic's original design, were associated with adjacent portfolio quadrants.;0;;;;;
Faes and Matthyssens found that several tactical sourcing levers can be implemented in multiple portfolio quadrants.;0;;;;;
In partnerships, long-term relationships are built.;4;;;;;
Often make-or-buy decisions are done prior to establishing a co-operation with partners.;4;;;;;
They report that sustainability objectives motivated companies to adopt intense collaboration and long-term contracts.;4;;;;;
In a recent work, Ate illustrated that many purchase category strategies can be implemented equally effectively in the same Kraljic quadrant.;0;;;;;
Cox even proposes that most tactical sourcing levers may be used for all purchases, no matter in which quadrant of the Kraljic matrix they were classified.;0;;;;;
Consequently, Hesping and Schiele state that, although certain category purchases may be assigned to the same portfolio quadrant, each category requires an individual set of tactical sourcing levers.;0;;;;;
So far, contemporary literature paid little attention to empirically verify if and how the distinct suggestions for each portfolio quadrant are applied in practice.;0;;;;;
To fill this gap, this study developed sourcing lever profiles for each quadrant of the Kraljic matrix from data collected in practice.;0;;;;;
Luzzini found that most publications in the context of purchasing portfolio models only considered the first steps of portfolio management, category classification and strategic priorities.;0;;;;;
Other studies might consider which levers and tools are used according to the different types of categories and different category priorities.;0;;;;;
The leverage item allows for vendor selection.;2;;;;;
The leverage item allows for product substitution.;2;;;;;
The leverage item allows for target pricing.;2;;;;;
There are several models of leverage in purchasing literature.;2;;;;;
While some studies focus on a rather strategic leverage such as long-term outsourcing decisions, this study focuses on the tactical sourcing levers used to implement strategy.;0;;;;;
Distinct from general strategy, tactics form clusters of activities with a concrete time specification and tractable milestones.;0;;;;;
In contrast to a purchasing strategy, tactical sourcing levers do not provide a general orientation for purchasing activities such as achieving annual cost reduction targets or fostering innovation.;0;;;;;
Rather, tactical sourcing levers describe sets of tactics used to operationalize strategy as a combination of activities in a sourcing category.;0;;;;;
In that respect, they cover multiple competitive priorities such as cost reduction, quality, innovation or security of supply.;0;;;;;
Extant literature describes several lever models with various activities merged into coherent groups or sets.;0;;;;;
Some models range from fifteen value levers merged into five lever groups, 64 methods grouped into sixteen levers in a purchasing chessboard to 114 tactical levers merged into seven categories of tactical levers.;0;;;;;
This study focuses on the empirically most elaborated sourcing lever model presented by Schiele, Schumacher and Schiele which has been applied in 134 cross-functional sourcing strategy workshops.;0;;;;;
Their taxonomy includes sets of similar activites grouped into seven core tactical sourcing levers Volume bundling, which refers to the consolidation of demand and increasing purchase volume.;0;;;;;
Price evaluation, which refers to forming price targets and analyzing suppliers bids, cost structures and value propositions.;0;;;;;
Extension of supply base, pertaining to increasing the number of sources and bidders per request for quotation.;0;;;;;
Product optimization, refering to modifications to the design, functions and materials of the purchased items.;0;;;;;
Process optimization, which refers to efficient and effective processes related to the buyer-seller interfaces.;0;;;;;
Optimization of supply relationships, which pertains to establishing and maintaining effective relationships between buyer and suppliers in the market.;4;;;;;
Category-spanned optimization, which relates to balancing trade-offs among multiple sourcing categories and adopting mutual approaches, applied by otherwise distinct sourcing teams.;0;;;;;
It is worth mentioning that these seven levers appear similar to the seven categories of tactical levers by Cox.;0;;;;;
However, to avoid confusion with the term sourcing category, we adopted the wording tactical sourcing lever to describe a set of similar tactical sourcing activities.;0;;;;;
Some tactical sourcing levers may appear identical to a strategy.;0;;;;;
Purchasing strategy may be defined in terms of strategic priorities such as cost, flexibility and innovation.;0;;;;;
To reach these strategic priorities, managers can choose a mix of sourcing tactics, tactical sourcing levers, made up of a set of activates to implement overall strategy.;0;;;;;
For example, to reach the strategic goal of innovation, managers might opt for the tactical sourcing lever product optimization followed by various activities to make modifications to the design, functions and materials of the purchased items.;0;;;;;
As another option, they might choose to implement the tactical sourcing lever optimization of supplier relationships in order to become more attractive towards a selected number of suppliers and their innovative products.;0;;;;;
Hence, optimization of supplier relationships can be understood as one out of several tactical sourcing levers to reach the strategic goal of innovation but not as a strategy by itself.;0;;;;;
Nevertheless, to be able to implement the tactical sourcing lever optimization of supplier relationships, appropriate supplier strategies at a subordinate level may be needed.;0;;;;;
Several recent studies present conceptual frameworks linking purchasing portfolios with tactical sourcing levers.;0;;;;;
Among these, Schuh, Hess, Lysons and Farrington and O'Brien are noted for grouping tactical sourcing levers into the quadrants of a purchasing portfolio matrix.;0;;;;;
However, in these literature sources, these concepts were developed solely for practical application, or only incidentally referred to previous academic work.;0;;;;;
Academics contributed relatively little to the identification of tactical sourcing levers that are most suitable for each portfolio quadrant within the Kraljic matrix.;0;;;;;
Exploitation of purchasing power is limited to leverage purchases.;2;;;;;
The present study aimed to assess whether and how the application of tactical sourcing levers varies among non-critical, leverage, bottleneck and strategic purchases.;0;;;;;
To achieve this objective, sourcing projects had to be classified and sourcing lever profiles developed for each portfolio quadrant.;0;;;;;
Multi-item scales were developed to collect data about strategic importance, supply risk and sourcing lever profiles for sourcing projects.;0;;;;;
Depending on a high score for strategic importance and supply risk, an observation could be classified into the strategic purchases.;4;;;;;
Ultimately, the sourcing lever profiles of the quadrants were formally analyzed with respect to differences and similarities using non-parametric tests.;0;;;;;
In this study, a multi-step process was used to develop and validate the survey instrument.;0;;;;;
A review of purchasing, marketing, operations and supply chain management literature was conducted to identify construct definitions and existing measures for strategic importance and supply risk.;0;;;;;
This allowed the adoption of the world methodology to develop survey items for each tactical sourcing lever via an academic-practitioner collaborative approach.;0;;;;;
The original analytic variables of Kraljic do not provide robust reflective, multi-item scales.;0;;;;;
For example, Kraljic, state that their mentioned analytic variables are not complete.;0;;;;;
The list of analytic variables in Kraljic ends, indirectly asking the reader to complement them.;0;;;;;
Over time, researchers have built on Kraljic's seminal work, developed and refined reflective, multi-item scales for purchase importance and supply risk.;0;;;;;
Therefore, to enable empirical evaluations in the subsequent course of this research, this paper moves beyond Kraljic's original analytic variables and integrates refined multi-item scales from contemporary literature.;0;;;;;
The first dimension was strategic importance, which relates to the financial and strategic significance of the purchase reflecting not only the direct monetary value but also the impact of the purchase outcome on the buying firm's goals, profitability and customer relationships.;0;;;;;
This also includes the degree to which the purchase is critical to the manufacture of a firm's products.;0;;;;;
To measure this construct, a 5-item scale for strategic importance was developed, incorporating two items related to monetary value and effect on profitability from Lau, one item about management priority and two items about relative importance from Ellis.;0;;;;;
Contingency plans have to be made in case supply is shortened.;3;;;;;
The second dimension was supply risk, which relates to the threat of a temporary or permanent perturbation or disruption of supply associated with a firm's supply network.;3;;;;;
This includes supplier business risks, such as capacity constraints, quality problems or technological changes in the supply market.;3;;;;;
In particular, this dimension pertains to the threat of financial instability of suppliers and the consequences of supplier default.;0;;;;;
Empirical evidence suggests that supply risk may stem from poor operational performance or opportunistic behavior of suppliers.;0;;;;;
Lock-in situations are an important threat, as they make an organization highly dependent on a supplier, due to the very limited number of alternative sources.;3;;;;;
For measuring this construct, a 7-item scale was developed that incorporates three items about capacity shortages, supply problems and supplier demise.;3;;;;;
The availability of alternative sources offers great possibilities for buyers.;2;;;;;
In completing the questionnaire, the respondents were required to state the extent to which they agreed with the corresponding statements on a 7-point Likert scale.;0;;;;;
Over time, literature discussed multiple sets of tactics related to purchasing portfolio models.;0;;;;;
As discussed previously, recent studies have systematized this knowledge and developed a taxonomy of seven core tactical sourcing levers, whereby each lever consists of a set of similar activities that are used to improve sourcing performance for a sourcing category.;0;;;;;
However, contemporary literature provides very limited guidance regarding the activites related to each lever which may serve as indicators in empirical investigations.;0;;;;;
Consequently, the present study capitalized on extensive collaboration with one large, global, automotive OEM to develop a list of indicators for the application of the seven core tactical sourcing levers.;0;;;;;
Tactical sourcing levers directly address actions that decision makers can take to achieve desired outcomes.;0;;;;;
This strong practical orientation suggests an academic-practitioner collaborative research approach to identify relevant indicators.;0;;;;;
In other academic-practitioner research collaborations, scholars tended to use Delphi method, focus groups or the world methodology.;0;;;;;
The Delphi method is based on a structured series of questionnaires with items and rankings followed by controlled feedback.;0;;;;;
However, the iterative survey process that can last several weeks was in most cases found disadvantageous as it often results in a low response rate.;0;;;;;
Distinct from the Delphi method, focus groups are a form of group interview that capitalizes on communication between research participants in order to generate data.;0;;;;;
However, the recommendation that the ideal focus group size is limited to 8 to 12 participants was found disadvantageous.;0;;;;;
Some authors also noted that multiple sessions for the same group may have to be scheduled to collect rich and stable data, making the process arduous and difficult to manage.;0;;;;;
The world is a promising and powerful approach to effective and efficient identification of items for a theoretical concept.;0;;;;;
In essence, it uses intimate conversations at small style tables, or in small conversation clusters, link, and build on each other as people move between groups, cross-pollinate ideas.;0;;;;;
Different from the majority of other quantitative and qualitative research approaches, world caf methodology directly integrates practitioners into the research process.;0;;;;;
It stimulates dialectic discussions between academics and practitioners and among practitioners with various backgrounds and experiences.;0;;;;;
This strategy avoids narrowly-minded toolbox thinking, while allowing a large group's knowledge to be captured much quicker than through the data collection process based on multiple interviews.;0;;;;;
Although the world caf shares some characteristics with focus groups, its distinguishing features make it more suitable for the present study's setting.;0;;;;;
First, the number of caf tables could be adjusted to allow involvement of 24 participants representing the focal company's entire range of sourcing categories.;0;;;;;
Second, the world caf can be held in one session, thus avoiding problems associated with reoccurring sessions, such as participant unavailability and attrition.;0;;;;;
The data collection strategy adopted in this study, as noted above, followed the basic world caf structure, suggested by Brown and Isaacs, Prewitt and Hoffmann.;0;;;;;
It comprised of the following activities.;0;;;;;
In the early stages of the caf preparation, academics and practitioners engaged over several months to come to a shared foundation of the research question.;0;;;;;
Simultaneously, moderators, location and possible participants of the world caf were identified.;0;;;;;
During the review of extant literature on sourcing levers, several cost saving activities were identified.;0;;;;;
To stimulate table discussions, these activities were printed on posters.;0;;;;;
The study participants were invited to change, add or integrate findings by making notes on the posters.;0;;;;;
Three tables with six to seven seats were set up to allow multiple participants from diverse backgrounds to participate in discussions, while retaining an intimate atmosphere that facilitates interaction.;0;;;;;
Three to four sourcing levers were discussed at each table.;0;;;;;
Three discussion rounds were held, each lasting 30 to 40 minutes.;0;;;;;
After each round, participants at each table split up to form new group constellations at different tables.;0;;;;;
While each participant was required to sit at each table, there was no pre-defined order.;0;;;;;
The main goal was to allow all individuals to engage in the discussion of all presented sourcing levers.;0;;;;;
At the end of the discussion rounds, academic facilitators and participants came together for a collective concluding session.;0;;;;;
Having just discussed all of the presented sourcing levers, participants now had the chance to contrast them, as well as eliminate possible overlaps and inconsistent findings.;0;;;;;
As a part of this session, each participant had the chance to evaluate the results by placing stickers on several indicators they considered the most important.;0;;;;;
As a result, 23 activities were assigned to the seven core tactical sourcing levers.;0;;;;;
The world caf discussions showed that purchasing agents differentiate various degrees to which they employ a certain tactical sourcing lever and corresponding activities.;0;;;;;
For example, when the entire volume was concentrated on one supplier respondents indicated an extensive use of that activity.;0;;;;;
However, when only a limited share of the volume was concentrated on one supplier respondents indicated less use of that activity.;0;;;;;
Similarly, if time and resources were limited for price evaluations, the recalculation sometimes focused on the raw material costs of one main component only.;0;;;;;
With more time and resources, recalculations may include the entire bill of materials as well as logistics and overhead costs.;0;;;;;
Therefore, in the subsequent survey, the respondents were asked to relate their answer to the time and resources invested in previous projects, indicating the extent to which they applied each sourcing activity using a 7-point Likert scale anchored extensively used.;0;;;;;
For this sourcing project, which activities of the following sourcing levers are used.;0;;;;;
Sample frame and data collection: front-line purchasing agents for direct purchases were questioned at the point of supplier nomination.;0;;;;;
Unit of analysis was the multitude of direct sourcing projects managed at the European headquarters of the same automotive OEM that took part in the world caf.;0;;;;;
The study intentionally focused on direct sourcing projects within a single OEM in order to get access to a reasonable number of comparable sourcing projects and front-line purchasing agents.;0;;;;;
Several of the analyzed tactical sourcing levers may be relevant to both direct purchases, which immediately enter the firm's core products, and indirect purchases, which tend to serve as input for the day-to-day business operations.;0;;;;;
However, indirect purchases were not included as the focal firm follows distinct purchasing processes for indirect purchases that might have limited the access to purchasing agents and biased the selection of sourcing projects and the employment of sourcing levers.;0;;;;;
The focal firm's category managers for direct purchases are directly involved in most purchasing activities.;0;;;;;
The focal firm's processes for indirect products in contrast, involve a high degree of decentralized orders from a wider number of non-professional buyers.;0;;;;;
For example, the category managers for direct purchases are immediately involved in employing the price evaluation lever, including value and cost analysis methods.;0;;;;;
Indirect purchases, in contrast highly use blanket order processes involving previous sourcing activities such as tender preparation by non-professional purchasers.;0;;;;;
Sourcing projects are not independent from each other in a way that volume bundling in a certain sourcing project, for example, may only become possible because related items from sourcing projects are bundled together to increase volume per request of quotation.;0;;;;;
With regard to this interdependence, the focal firm has an established category management process, forcing category managers to regularly review their sourcing projects in the context of related sourcing projects and the entire purchasing department.;0;;;;;
This breath of experience allowed the respondents to relate to a wider range of sourcing projects when answering the strategic importance and the category-spanning optimization survey items.;0;;;;;
The OEM's direct purchasing activities are highly centralized.;0;;;;;
Nearly all of the purchasing projects are managed by the category managers being situated at the European headquarters.;0;;;;;
That way, the full global range of the OEM's direct purchasing activities could be accessed for this study.;0;;;;;
Most of the category managers have a common European cultural background which might have influenced their choice of sourcing levers.;0;;;;;
However, in the category management process the category managers regularly coordinate their approaches with purchasing entities in the involved global regions.;0;;;;;
Hence, it was not expected that cultural preferences have a strong influence on their choice of tactical sourcing levers.;0;;;;;
For the category managers, the overarching strategy for the entire purchasing department only functions as rough guidelines.;0;;;;;
At the core of their decision making are the specific characteristics of the sourcing category.;0;;;;;
Nevertheless, as a possible limitation, the OEM's overall business strategy might have limited the choice of tactical sourcing levers by the questioned category managers.;0;;;;;
To minimize this limitation, at the beginning of this study, academics and practitioners engaged for a period of more than two years.;0;;;;;
Thereby, it was found that the OEM's purchasing organization has reached a high degree of maturity.;0;;;;;
The OEM's overall business strategy builds the basis for its purchasing policies and is fully reflected in its functional purchasing strategy.;0;;;;;
Next to cost saving targets, the functional purchasing strategy includes targets for innovation, security of supply, quality and sustainability which are broken down to each sourcing category.;0;;;;;
Previous studies assume that mature purchasing organizations apply world-class best practices.;0;;;;;
Therefore, it is expected that an extensive range of tactical sourcing levers is applied by a mature purchasing organization to the OEM's sourcing projects.;0;;;;;
All survey items were pre-tested with an expert panel of category managers from the focal firm, none of whom previously took part in the research process.;0;;;;;
They were asked to check the relevance of all questions and identify vague concepts or unfamiliar terms.;0;;;;;
To minimize bias arising from information recall, the supplier nomination stage was chosen as point of reference for the purchaser.;0;;;;;
For supplier nomination, the category manager has to present the strategic rationale of the respective sourcing project to management at the corporate sourcing committee.;0;;;;;
The data collection process aimed to generate a data set that represents the full range of the focal company's direct sourcing projects.;0;;;;;
Thereby, data about 107 direct sourcing projects could be collected between May and September 2014.;0;;;;;
The focal company launched products and respective sourcing projects throughout the year.;0;;;;;
Therefore, it was expected that the data set is not affected by seasonal effect or exceptional sourcing events.;0;;;;;
Each time a supply contract was awarded and registered in the IT-system in the respective period, the responsible category manager was visited by the researcher and the questionnaire was completed jointly.;0;;;;;
In this way, and random selection of sourcing projects and a maximum validity was ensured generating high quality data.;0;;;;;
In a few cases, several projects have been completed and registered in the IT-system by the responsible purchaser in the same period.;0;;;;;
In that case, one sourcing project has been randomly drawn by the researcher.;0;;;;;
Due to the IT-system architecture, some of the registered sourcing projects are solely virtual and do not reflect really existing sourcing projects.;0;;;;;
These virtual sourcing projects might stem from a new version of a sourcing project in the IT-system, when for example making changes to the technical quotation documents during the quotation process.;0;;;;;
The researchers payed attention that none of these virtual sourcing projects entered the data set.;0;;;;;
Initially, confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess reliability and validity of the multi-item, reflective scales for strategic importance and supply risk.;0;;;;;
Survey items, item-to-construct loadings, means, standard deviations, average variance extracted and scale reliabilities are listed in reports on inter-construct loadings.;0;;;;;
All item-to-construct loadings were significant and were well above the cut-off value of 0.7 indicating a substantive contribution.;0;;;;;
Reliability of the scales was also tested using Cronbach's alpha, average variance extracted, and composite reliability scores.;0;;;;;
Cronbach's alpha and CR statistics both substantially exceed the threshold value of 0.7, indicating internal consistency.;0;;;;;
In addition, both scales surpass the minimum value of 0.5 for AVE, indicating convergent validity.;0;;;;;
Discriminant validity of the scales was also assessed by checking the item-to- construct loadings and using the Fornell-Larcker criterion.;0;;;;;
The item loadings onto the corresponding construct showed no critical levels of cross-loadings, while all square roots of the AVE were higher than the corresponding inter-construct correlations, indicating unidimensionality.;0;;;;;
Thereafter, the analyzed sourcing projects were classified into the quadrants of the Kraljic matrix.;0;;;;;
Namely non-critical, which are of low strategic importance and low supply risk.;1;;;;;
Leverage items are characterized by high strategic importance and low supply risk.;2;;;;;
Bottleneck items are characterized by a low strategic importance but a high supply risk.;3;;;;;
Strategic purchases include compenents with high strategic importance and high supply risk.;4;;;;;
Using dichotomization by mean split, the continuous measurements for strategic importance and supply risk were used to create low and high groups based on whether the scores were greater or less than the mean of the 7-point Likert scale.;0;;;;;
An observation was classified as low if the variable score was below 4 and as high if the score was equal or above 4.;0;;;;;
Finally, as part of this investigation, profiles for the 23 activities as well as for the aggregated tactical sourcing levers were developed for each of the four portfolio quadrants.;0;;;;;
The scores for each of the seven tactical sourcing levers were calculated from the mean of the corresponding sourcing activities.;0;;;;;
These profiles were subsequently compared with the average profile across all 107 sourcing projects.;0;;;;;
Then, the profiles were formally tested for significant differences and similarities among the portfolio quadrants using non-parametric tests.;0;;;;;
Thereby, the Kruskal-Wallis allowed analyzing differences and similarities jointly among all four portfolio quadrants, while the Mann-Whitney test allowed separate analyses of pairs of two portfolio quadrants.;0;;;;;
Similar to formative indicators, each activity defines a different aspect of the same domain, a tactical sourcing lever.;0;;;;;
Therefore, the activities related to the same tactical sourcing lever were not required to correlate.;0;;;;;
The test results for each analyzed activity and tactical sourcing lever are reported in the Appendix A 7-point.;0;;;;;
To allow for a visual interpretation, the test results for the seven tactical sourcing levers have also been plotted.;0;;;;;
In the following paragraphs, the sourcing lever profiles and significant differences across portfolio quadrants were discussed in relation to the generic tactics from the literature review.;0;;;;;
The findings in the following discussion need to be interpreted with regard to the fact that this study intentionally focused on direct sourcing projects within one large, global automotive OEM to allow accessing the knowledge of front-line purchasing agents.;0;;;;;
Remedies have been taken to reduce potential bias as described in the sections on data collection and limitations.;0;;;;;
The pattern of sourcing lever application may potentially be influenced by the respondents norms they developed in response distinct degrees of strategic importance and supply risk.;0;;;;;
Non-critical purchases are easy to source.;1;;;;;
This portfolio quadrant is characterized by a below average strategic importance and a below average supply risk.;1;;;;;
The below average scores for optimization of supply relationships and product optimization fit well to generic tactical suggestions.;1;;;;;
Non-critical purchases are less complex.;1;;;;;
Available literature suggests forging a greater variety of transactional supplier relationships, while product standardization becomes important for reducing the effort of managing a large number of technical variants.;1;;;;;
However, in contrast to this advice, in this study, volume bundling was the least utilized approach across all four portfolio quadrants.;0;;;;;
Non-critical purchases show similar scores for extension of supply base and price evaluation.;1;;;;;
Non-critical products are supposed to require a rationalization of the supply base, without the need to conduct price evaluation such as target or open book costing.;1;;;;;
These products are characterized by an above average strategic importance and a below average supply risk.;2;;;;;
Leverage purchases score below average for product optimization only.;2;;;;;
Such purchases are of a high monetary value and allow choosing among several alternative suppliers.;2;;;;;
Purchasing teams strongly exploit the company's buying power through price evaluation, volume bundling and extension of supply base.;2;;;;;
They do actively collaborate with suppliers in terms of product optimization.;4;;;;;
Purchasing teams relied the most on price evaluation and significantly more than when making bottleneck purchases.;3;;;;;
Bottleneck purchases account for purchases in which there are just a few suppliers with high power.;3;;;;;
This portfolio quadrant is characterized by a below average strategic importance and an above average supply risk.;3;;;;;
Bottleneck purchases score below average for strategic importance.;3;;;;;
Only optimization of supply relationships approached the average value.;0;;;;;
Available literature suggests focusing on volume insurance.;3;;;;;
Purchasing teams relied more on optimization of supply relationships than on extension of supply base to establish alternative sources.;3;;;;;
Significantly less effort was invested into extension of supply base, participants were much more reliant on optimization of supply relationships.;3;;;;;
In addition, product optimization seems to have a very limited potential only.;0;;;;;
In the case of strategic purchases, purchasers invest significantly more effort into product optimization.;4;;;;;
This portfolio quadrant is characterized by an above average strategic importance and an above average supply risk.;4;;;;;
Strategic purchases scored above average for collaboration and co-operation for joint development.;4;;;;;
The highest scores were noted for product optimization followed by volume bundling.;4;;;;;
Literature on this subject suggests sophisticated and privileged, cooperative sourcing approaches for strategic purchases.;4;;;;;
This study's findings show that a wide range of tactical sourcing levers and much effort is invested into strategic purchases.;4;;;;;
Purchasing teams placed great importance on product optimization and optimization of supply relationships.;4;;;;;
In bottleneck purchases, purchasing teams relied significantly on product optimization.;3;;;;;
In comparison, strategic products score the highest on optimization of supply relationships.;4;;;;;
However, in variance to the recommendations in literature, attaining bargaining power seems to be even more important, for the current study participants, as volume bundling and extension of supply base were identified as the most frequently used tactical sourcing levers for strategic purchases.;0;;;;;
Findings yielded by the present study identify two groups of tactical sourcing levers, the first of which consists of volume bundling, price evaluation and extension of supply base.;0;;;;;
In nearly all portfolio quadrants, these are the most frequently employed levers.;0;;;;;
These represent what authors call the transaction-oriented, more traditional sourcing levers focused on capturing most of the value on the supply market in a rather adversarial approach.;0;;;;;
The second group consists of product optimization, process optimization, optimization of supply relationships and category-spanned optimization.;0;;;;;
In this study, these are the least used levers for nearly all portfolio quadrants.;0;;;;;
According to the extant literature, these levers are intended to focus on creating value in the supply market via a relationship-oriented, more advanced approach.;0;;;;;
In the analyzed sourcing projects, purchasing teams generally tend to apply transaction-oriented levers to all portfolio quadrants and selectively add more efforts to relationship-oriented levers, when strategic importance increases and supply risk reduces.;0;;;;;
It is striking that the scores for most tactical sourcing levers are below the mid-point of the 7-point Likert scale with little deviation.;0;;;;;
Only volume bundling and price evaluation just score above the mid-point for nearly all portfolio quadrants.;0;;;;;
Overall, the data shows that the respondents opted for a wide range of sourcing levers without focusing on a few or single lever in extreme form.;0;;;;;
Several of the present study findings are well aligned with the tactics recommended in pertinent literature.;0;;;;;
Price evaluation has been most applied to leverage and strategic purchases.;2;;;;;
This corresponds to studies recommending target pricing for leverage purchases. ;2;;;;;
Calling for long-term, privileged relationships, optimization of supply relationships was most applied for strategic purchases.;4;;;;;
Still, in many cases, empirical reality diverges from the conceptual, normative recommendations.;0;;;;;
Optimization of supply relationships is frequently used for bottleneck purchases.;3;;;;;
For strategic purchases, volume bundling and price evaluation are even more employed than that the highly recommended optimization of supply relationships.;4;;;;;
Moreover, several publications create the impression that most tactical sourcing levers are exclusively limited to a single portfolio quadrant.;0;;;;;
Efficient processing is deemend applicable solely to non-critical purchases.;1;;;;;
 Long-term supply relationships pertain to strategic purchases only.;4;;;;;
However, findings yielded by this study confirm that, although literature makes generic recommendations for a certain portfolio quadrant, this does not mean that the rest of the requirements does not apply in that quadrant.;0;;;;;
They do, but it helps to understand the prime focus for each quadrant.;0;;;;;
Thus, the present study is the first to provide survey-based empirical evidence supporting the conclusion that tactical sourcing levers are not exclusive to a specific portfolio quadrant.;0;;;;;
Rather, the entire range of tactical sourcing levers is applied in practice to each portfolio quadrant.;0;;;;;
Purchasers tend to dedicate more effort to the process when moving from very risky bottleneck scenarios.;3;;;;;
recommended extension of the supply base as a means of expanding the network of alternative sources.;3;;;;;
The least effort was invested into bottleneck purchases.;3;;;;;
For non-critical purchases, more effort was added, especially to extension of supply base, product optimization and price evaluation.;1;;;;;
Efforts increased further for strategic purchases, in particular for optimization of supply relationships and volume bundling.;4;;;;;
For leverage purchases, effort was invested into price evaluation and category-spanned optimization.;2;;;;;
Tactical sourcing levers are applied in an additive manner, rather as alternatives.;0;;;;;
Caniels and Gelderman give a possible explanation for this phenomenon.;0;;;;;
In their analysis, the buyer-supplier relationships for bottleneck purchases are supplier-dominated.;3;;;;;
Leverage purchases are buyer-dominated.;2;;;;;
A supplier-dominated power regime may lead to lock-in situations in which the buyers ability to enforce their goals and tactics is often very limited.;3;;;;;
Buyer dominance increases the buyers influence and value appropriation.;2;;;;;
Consequently, in the analyzed data set, buyers may have spent the least efforts on tactical sourcing levers for bottleneck purchases.;3;;;;;
To date, in supply management, purchasing portfolio models have been widely adopted to cluster and strategically manage different types of purchases.;0;;;;;
Although it still attracts criticism, the Kraljic matrix remains the dominant approach in purchasing portfolio management.;0;;;;;
The traditional idea of the matrix is appealing as purchases are grouped into four portfolio quadrants, namely non-critical, leverage, bottleneck and strategic purchases.;0;;;;;
This classification is based on the strategic importance of each acquisition and the supply risk they impose for the buyer.;0;;;;;
Purchasers follow tactical recommendations for each portfolio quadrant to maximize purchasing performance.;0;;;;;
However, in practice, strategy implementation is not that straight forward, as it typically requires discussing and balancing a set tactics.;0;;;;;
Tactical sourcing levers have an immediate practical relevance as they address the activities that purchasers use to achieve their goals.;0;;;;;
Extant research on portfolio models contributed little to the effort to verify if, in practice, tactical sourcing levers are applied according to the specific, generic recommendations for each portfolio quadrant.;0;;;;;
This study set out to rectify this omission.;0;;;;;
Following a mixed methods approach, a survey instrument was developed based on a literature review and highly interactive world caf discussions.;0;;;;;
Measurement scales were subsequently developed for the seven core tactical sourcing lever, comprising of volume bundling, price evaluation, extension of supply base, product optimization, process optimization, optimization of supply relationships and category-spanned optimization.;0;;;;;
Thereafter, 107 direct sourcing projects were analyzed for their strategic importance, supply risk and sourcing lever profile.;0;;;;;
The sourcing projects were thus classified into non-critical, leverage, bottleneck and strategic purchases.;0;;;;;
Finally, these groups of sourcing projects were tested with respect to differences and similarities in the application of the seven core tactical sourcing levers.;0;;;;;
The findings of this study call for a more differentiated view on recommendations by portfolio models, as was already suggested a decade ago.;0;;;;;
The study confirms that tactical sourcing levers are not applied as alternatives.;0;;;;;
Previous studies on portfolio models have tended to focus on overall strategic recommendations for each portfolio quadrant.;0;;;;;
Thereby, they have contrasted portfolio quadrants in terms of differences in product characteristics, purchasing skills, buyer-supplier relationships, power structures and organizational structures.;0;;;;;
This study goes beyond the approach adopted in these works, as it empirically links specific, actionable tactical sourcing levers to purchasing portfolio theory.;0;;;;;
The study presents several contributions.;0;;;;;
First, as initially intended by Kraljic's policy issues, the present study confirms that purchasing portfolio theory can play an important role in choosing and configuring a set of tactics to improve purchasing performance.;0;;;;;
Its findings show that purchasers clearly apply a differentiated profile of tactical sourcing levers to each portfolio quadrant.;0;;;;;
By operationalizing the seven discussed core tactical sourcing levers, this study provides 23 activities that can be applied in practice as a checklist to identify improvement potentials or each sourcing project.;0;;;;;
This activity level of analysis may provide a rich line of inquiry for future studies.;0;;;;;
It may for example be interesting to analyze in more details why some of the activities from each tactical sourcing lever did or did not vary between the portfolio quadrants, as potentially expected.;0;;;;;
Second, the study provides evidence that purchasers differentiate between two groups of tactical sourcing levers.;0;;;;;
More specifically, volume bundling, price evaluation and extension of supply base are mainly transaction-oriented and focus on capturing existing value.;0;;;;;
These levers have been applied most frequently in the sample analyzed in this study, irrespective of the portfolio quadrant.;0;;;;;
Product optimization, process optimization, optimization of supply relationships and category-spanned optimization are predominately relationship-oriented and focus on creating value in collaboration with various actors.;4;;;;;
These levers require collaboration across multiple functions.;4;;;;;
However, they have been used the least across all portfolio quadrants.;0;;;;;
For several years, many scholars assumed superiority of relationship-orientation over transaction-orientation in purchasing.;0;;;;;
However, this study yielded the contrary findings.;0;;;;;
Hence, it might be fruitful to further examine at the tactical level why purchasers invest greater effort into transaction-oriented than into relationship-oriented approaches, as well as whether trade-offs exist between these approaches.;0;;;;;
In the analyzed sample, purchasing teams did not limit certain tactical sourcing levers exclusively to a single portfolio quadrant.;0;;;;;
Each of the seven core tactical sourcing levers was applied to all portfolio quadrants.;0;;;;;
This confirms earlier critique on a deterministic adoption and implementation of the generic recommendations for each portfolio quadrant, such as forming cooperative partnerships for all strategic purchases.;4;;;;;
Yet, the full range of tactical sourcing levers may be used in each of the four quadrants.;0;;;;;
This finding has important implications on the way portfolio models are used: The generic recommendations made by purchasing portfolio models and other management tools may serve as spaces for debate and social interaction but will most probably not provide the definite answer to strategic or tactical problems.;0;;;;;
Purchasing portfolio models may especially be useful in the discussion about general purchasing approaches at a more abstract, general level with personnel from other functions which are not directly involved with purchasing activities.;0;;;;;
However, in the implementation, purchasing professionals may still opt for the tactics that best fit the supply market conditions of the sourcing category at hand, even if they are not among the generic recommendations.;0;;;;;
Future research might ask whether a strict, deterministic adherence to generic recommendation may even reduce purchasing performance.;0;;;;;
In the analyzed sample, more effort to implement tactical sourcing levers was added when moving from bottleneck, to non-critical, to strategic and finally to leverage purchases.;0;;;;;
Purchasing teams clearly concentrated their activities on strategic purchases, since a lot of analysis has to be done.;4;;;;;
This suggests that the application of tactical sourcing levers within the Kraljic matrix is done in an additive manner.;0;;;;;
This additive pattern suggests that purchasers draw the attention to particularly important and critical purchases to limit the extent of necessary analyses and data, which might in fact be a meaningful pattern of time and resource allocation.;0;;;;;
A possible explanation may be that purchasers adapted their effort to the portfolio quadrant-specific power structures and resulting prospects of success.;0;;;;;
Bottleneck purchases are often supplier-dominated and may thus be less favorable for the purchasers to reach their goals.;3;;;;;
The buyer-dominated leverage purchases are usually of bigger volumes.;2;;;;;
Previous findings suggest that a purchasing portfolio analysis should play a major role in determining resources and involvement of purchasing teams.;0;;;;;
Future studies might address this point to better understand how a sourcing team's resource availability influences performance outcomes in each of the four portfolio quadrants.;0;;;;;
Do more resources in each quadrant lead to more success or should these resources mainly be bundled on the important and critical purchases as Kraljic suggests?;0;;;;;
In conclusion, findings yielded by this study confirm that the logic of the deterministic, generic recommendations made in the quadrants of the Kraljic matrix are not coherent, are sometimes misguided and often lead to the cherry-picking of sourcing levers from other quadrants.;0;;;;;
In the light of the on-going debate about the rigor and robustness of the Kraljic matrix, future research and practice may build on a finer differentiated approach to purchasing category management as discussed by the concept of category supply management, power positioning tools, category management in purchasing or the concept of modern category management.;0;;;;;
To account better for the peculiarities of each material or service group, organizations may move away from a limited number of four or nine portfolio cells towards a finer differentiation of sourcing categories.;0;;;;;
In a modern category management approach, a firm may distinguish several hundreds of sourcing categories, such as metal sheets, battery systems or leather applications, based on differentiators such as production technology, supplier competences or market-facing areas.;0;;;;;
Ultimately, instead of following generic, norm strategies and tactics for all materials or services placed in the same portfolio quadrant, category managers might follow an individual strategy for each sourcing category, even when placed in the same portfolio area.;0;;;;;
Purchasing portfolio models and their generic recommendations may still play an important role to cluster a firm's or department's range of sourcing categories and serve as a platform for a fruitful discussion about possible purchasing approaches among the involved stakeholders.;0;;;;;
However, these generic recommendations will most likely not provide a definite answer.;0;;;;;
A finer differentiated market understanding of modern category management with potentially hundreds of individual sourcing category strategies, may require entirely new predictive tools that help the front-line purchasers in choosing which activities are more or less appropriate in particular circumstances.;0;;;;;
A major strength of this study lies in the research design which relies on the experience of front-line purchasing agents, most knowledgeable about the sourcing context and tactical sourcing levers they have to consider in their daily work.;0;;;;;
The study intentionally focused on direct sourcing projects sourced within a timeframe of 6 month within one large, global automotive OEM to allow for intense academic-practitioner collaboration.;0;;;;;
Moreover, this focus also facilitated access to the knowledge of a comparable and reasonably large group of purchasing agents within a consistent organizational context.;0;;;;;
The automotive industry generally includes a large variety of purchased items.;0;;;;;
Still, the study is unlikely to provide general guidelines for other industries, and especially for the service or the public sector.;0;;;;;
Further data collection in other industries and the public sector, including indirect purchases and a different time period for additional testing of the proposed patterns in tactical sourcing lever application, is desirable.;0;;;;;
Strategic importance and supply risk and thus the positioning of products in the Kraljic matrix may change over time.;0;;;;;
Therefore, this study intentionally focused on sourcing levers profiles within a limited time frame to allow a classification of the respective sourcing projects into the Kraljic matrix.;0;;;;;
However, sourcing projects are not independent from each other as one tactical sourcing levers might have been applied in the past and therefore no longer be relevant to a particular sourcing project on a later occasion.;0;;;;;
In other word, previous sourcing projects might have limited the respondent's choice of sourcing levers in the analyzed sourcing projects.;0;;;;;
Future studies may address this limitation and analyze how sourcing lever application and success is influenced along a series of sourcing projects in a longitudinal study.;0;;;;;
This might be due to the industry sample, as customized, complex and costly systems are typically purchased in the automotive industry.;0;;;;;
Therefore, broader cross-industrial investigations across a greater number of regions and cultures might help to strengthen the generalizability of the findings along a wider range of research problems.;0;;;;;
For instance, the low incidence of relation-oriented strategies in this sample may be the expression of corporate culture.;0;;;;;
Research on tactical sourcing levers can still be considered as work in progress.;0;;;;;
This study focused on the knowledge gained from purchasing-related practitioners.;0;;;;;
However, purchasers increasingly work in cross-functional teams which can also affect their choice and range of available tactical sourcing levers.;0;;;;;
Future research might thus go beyond the existing frameworks to integrate practitioners from other supply market-related functions such as engineering, logistics or quality management into the research process.;0;;;;;
So far, the study lacks evidence on tangible outcomes of whether tactical sourcing levers were, or were not, successfully applied in practice.;0;;;;;
Future research may address this opportunity and analyze how successful category managers are in cherry picking tactical sourcing levers from any of the recommendations made by Kraljic.;0;;;;;
If they are successful, although they infringe on Kraljic's or other author's recommendations this could fundamentally question the utility of the Kraljic matrix and portfolio models in general.;0;;;;;
Purchasing strategies are a significant contributing factor to the overall performance of a firm.;0;;;;;
Not only has it been argued that transitioning purchasing from a tactical to a strategic role provides sustainable competitive advantage, compelling evidence supports the relationship between strategic purchasing and supplier integration, performance, power, and total cost of ownership among other benefits.;0;;;;;
Consequently, it has become widely accepted that establishing a strategic purchasing approach is imperative for today's firm.;0;;;;;
Towards this goal, employing a purchasing portfolio approach has become prevalent in both academia and within organizations to improve strategic purchasing.;0;;;;;
The most established portfolio model in literature and practice is Kraljic's model known as the Kraljic Portfolio Matrix.;0;;;;;
The KPM employs a matrix comprised of four portfolio quadrants to categorize purchases according to a range of internal, product, profit and operational factors along with external, supply market conditions.;0;;;;;
The general idea behind the KPM is to minimize supply vulnerability and maximize buying power while at the same time matching external resources provided by suppliers with the internal needs of the buying firm.;0;;;;;
The KPM has been found to provide additional benefits, visualizing and illustrating the purchasing strategy, and diversifying supplier power dependencies.;3;;;;;
Thus, the KPM approach has been argued to represent the single most diagnostic and prescriptive tool available to purchasing organizations.;0;;;;;
However, the Kraljic model is not without its critics.;0;;;;;
One of the primary weaknesses of the KPM is the qualitative nature of the model, which results in a subjective method for weighting and positioning suppliers or commodities in the quadrants.;0;;;;;
In fact, Olsen and Ellram emphasized that the weighting of each factor, which helps to determine the positioning, is the most important part of the implementation process, but at the same time is one of the most subjective elements of the KPM model and decision-makers must come to an agreement on these inputs.;0;;;;;
To address this Padhi argue for less subjective methods for positioning purchases on the matrix.;0;;;;;
However, advancements with this concern have been slow.;0;;;;;
Other concerns with the KPM exist such as weakness in the measurement of dimensions and variables, lack of prescriptive suggestions for proactively changing the existing power dependence, disregard for the supplier side, and the failure to account for interdependencies between products and between agent relationships.;0;;;;;
Nevertheless, even among these critics, there is wide consensus that the KPM model provides a useful tool for describing and differentiating purchasing situations and developing appropriate sourcing strategies.;0;;;;;
The purpose of this paper is to address some of these concerns.;0;;;;;
We propose the use of decision analysis to provide a systematic quantitative approach to making better decisions.;0;;;;;
By incorporating decision analysis, we advance the KPM model to become more objective in nature.;0;;;;;
Specifically, we propose the use of multi-objective decision analysis as a quantitative framework to objectively position purchases in the KPM matrix along with identifying which products and services to begin strategic sourcing efforts with.;0;;;;;
We demonstrate our approach by positioning major products and services procured by an organization which sources over $10 billion per year for products and services across 79 locations.;0;;;;;
Consequently, this paper contributes to the literature in two ways.;0;;;;;
Providing a novel approach to objectively and quantitatively position products and services within the KPM.;0;;;;;
Providing decision makers an approach to identify those products and services that are optimal candidates to begin strategic sourcing initiatives.;0;;;;;
The outline of this paper follows.;0;;;;;
First, we provide a succinct overview of purchasing portfolio models and the current gap in the literature for quantitatively positioning items within the KPM.;0;;;;;
We then outline our proposed methodology along with the use-case application of our approach to a subset of the organization's products and services.;0;;;;;
We then discuss the results and insights garnered from our analysis and end the paper with a short discussion of recommendations, future work and concluding statements.;0;;;;;
Modern portfolio theory dates back to 1952 when Markowitz introduced a framework for assembling a portfolio of assets to balance expected return for a given level of risk.;0;;;;;
The concept of portfolio models subsequently diffused into the strategic management, marketing, and production literature followed by the purchasing domain.;0;;;;;
Purchasing portfolio models provide an approach for differentiating suppliers and commodities.;0;;;;;
Purchasing portfolio models have received considerable attention from academia and within organizations.;0;;;;;
This attention is driven by the recognition that the ability of the firm to manage supplier relations has been empirically linked to obtaining and sustaining a competitive advantage.;0;;;;;
Moreover, suppliers have played an increasingly significant role in the success of firm.;0;;;;;
However, all suppliers cannot be dealt with in the same way and the literature supports the need to differentiate supplier relationships through differentiation schemes offered by purchasing portfolio models.;0;;;;;
Kraljic introduced the first comprehensive portfolio approach for purchasing and supply management.;0;;;;;
Although other models have been developed, Kraljic's approach has become the dominant methodology built upon in literature and the foundation for purchasing strategies for many organizations.;0;;;;;
Kraljic's approach leverages a portfolio matrix that classifies products on the basis of two dimensions: the external dimension concerns the factors regarding suppliers and supply market, while the internal dimension relates to the importance and value impact of a given product.;0;;;;;
Each dimension needs to be assessed against a number of variables where an overall classification score is established.;0;;;;;
The result is a matrix and a classification in four categories.;0;;;;;
Non-critical items are associated with low value items.;1;;;;;
Leverage the buyer power.;2;;;;;
A product offered only by a few suppliers.;3;;;;;
Strategic items as illustrated can be found in Joint Ventures.;4;;;;;
This categorization allows commodities to be classified in a way that minimizes the supply risk while maximizing purchasing power and value to the firm.;0;;;;;
There are several variants to the KPM.;0;;;;;
However, most alternatives build on and extend the KPM by focusing on the factors and variables to be measured.;0;;;;;
Table 1 illustrates only a few variants published in the purchasing literature.;0;;;;;
Positioning commodities in this matrix form not only enables managers to visually see trade-offs between items, but the classification also allows firms to develop distinctive management approaches for each category.;0;;;;;
In fact, they identified three generalized supplier strategies to associate with the purchasing strength versus supply market strength power positions.;0;;;;;
Exploiting means, leveraging buying power, whether through aggressive or collaborative means.;2;;;;;
Balance: implement neither aggressive nor conservative purchasing approach.;0;;;;;
Diversify the supply base by search for new suppliers or substitutes.;3;;;;;
In addition to the variations in what determines the positioning of products, the KPM has also been used to shift products within the matrix.;0;;;;;
The simplicity and flexibility of the KPM design has been a significant contributing factor to its popularity.;0;;;;;
Moreover, empirical studies have corroborated the usefulness and validity of KPM and purchasing portfolio analysis in practice.;0;;;;;
Caniels and Gelderman assessed the credibility of the KPM and the factors applied to measure supply risk and value impact.;0;;;;;
Leveraging data from Dutch purchasing professionals, they found theoretical and real situations that largely satisfy the purchasing strategies while assigning different commodities to the KPM.;0;;;;;
Wagner and Johnson used interview and archival data for multinational companies and found a strong relationship between the portfolio approach and competitive advantages obtained.;0;;;;;
Bensaou and Lilliecreutz and Ydreskog found that firms benefit from entering into a variety of relationships with different suppliers as directed by a KPM porfolio approach.;0;;;;;
Ipso facto, purchasing porfolio analysis has been found to be one of the top purchasing and supply tools used in industry, second only to vendor rating.;0;;;;;
However, one of the KPM's main critiques revolves around the question.;0;;;;;
How does a purchasing manager position a product or service within the matrix?;0;;;;;
Most of the research regarding the KPM involves the framework itself, movement within the framework, application of the framework to industry, strategies for the matrix categories, and buyer-supplier relationships that underpin management decisions prior to or after placement.;0;;;;;
In fact, Padhi, state that positioning commodities in the KPM suggested in the literature are mainly based on subjective judgment of the decision makers to position the commodities in the different quadrants.;0;;;;;
They lack analytical rigor, where subjective positioning of commodities may lead to erroneous outcomes.;0;;;;;
Wagner and Johnson add that despite the abundance of research on relationship patterns and their impact on company performance, the how-to question has been widely neglected.;0;;;;;
Ramsay identifies an absence of a conceptual framework to facilitate an analytical approach.;0;;;;;
Padhi add that positioning of the items in the portfolio matrix by the purchasing managers are subjective and makes the portfolio models imprecise.;0;;;;;
Knight reiterate the lack of analytical rigor, the difficulty in measuring the matrix dimensions, and the argument for less subjective methods for positioning purchases on the matrix.;0;;;;;
Lee and Drake argue that lack of the synthesizing of qualitative and quantitative measures promote arbitrary classification of purchases.;0;;;;;
Olsen and Ellram emphasize that categorizing of purchases in a portfolio model is very subjective, and perhaps the most important part of the implementation process and urge the use of quantitative methodologies.;0;;;;;
Although not exhaustive, a review of literature identified only five attempts to use quantitative techniques to position items with the KPM.;0;;;;;
Three of the five techniques rely on the concept of importance weights or importance scoring.;0;;;;;
A review of the decision analysis literature reveals there may be a better approach.;0;;;;;
The problem with importance weights is that they may not take into account the range between the least- and most-preferred options on each attribute.;0;;;;;
Rather, swing weighting has become a common approach to more accurately capture the importance trade-space of given attributes.;0;;;;;
There is a unique difference between importance weighting and swing weighting.;0;;;;;
Importance weights are used to reflect the general importance of one attribute over another without regard to the difference between the worst and the best value points of each attribute.;0;;;;;
Watson and Buede further state that when this difference from worst to best is not explicitly referenced in assessing weights, we obtain some general notion of importance, which is subject to great variation and argument among decision-makers.;0;;;;;
Dillon-Merrill argue that importance weights do not take into account the range between the lowest and the highest levels of the value measures resulting in the potential for important measures to not be important to the decision.;0;;;;;
Keeney adds that when we quantify objectives by simply asking for their relative importance, considerable misinformation about values is produced and a substantial opportunity to understand values is lost.;0;;;;;
However, the use of swing weighting ensures we capture the full value preference structure rather than simply an arbitrary score or at best a hierarchy of importance.;0;;;;;
Swing weighting also protects against the potential for loss of information, misunderstanding of decision-maker belief, and even loss of trade-offs between values.;0;;;;;
Zhenfeng apply factor analysis techniques to the dimensions of the KPM.;0;;;;;
However, the model lacks sufficient detail in derivation of variable scoring and positioning of items.;0;;;;;
In all, the ability to extend this model for practical use is limited and its ease of implementation is inadequate.;0;;;;;
The remaining quantitative method used to position items with the KPM is the Analytical Hierarchy Process.;0;;;;;
This approach is not without its flaws.;0;;;;;
From a general methodological viewpoint concerning AHP, Watson and Buede argue that although definitions for levels of importance are articulated, inconsistencies between importance pairings are common and additional methods must be used to resolve differences.;0;;;;;
They add that instead of getting a decision-maker to wrestle with his values, the AHP tells him what they ought to be.;0;;;;;
They further highlight that AHP fails to provide clarity between attributes by using a somewhat arbitrary representation of words by numbers which may be implying an underlying judgment structure which the decision-maker is unaware of and may disagree with.;0;;;;;
The AHP is traditionally applied to the evaluation of alternatives, generates rank orderings that are not meaningful with respect to the underlying preferences of the decision maker.;0;;;;;
He adds that the approach seems overly complex with its need for sometimes extensive pairwise comparisons of alternatives and extensive mathematical calculations to determine rankings.;0;;;;;
These characteristics seem to obscure, rather than illuminate, the trade-offs involved in making decisions with multiple objectives.;0;;;;;
The discussion above highlights what can be considered a gap in literature to date.;0;;;;;
The necessity to identify and apply a quantitative method to position items within the KPM is therefore a pressing need, prior to undertaking subsequent analysis.;0;;;;;
The data used for this research comes from a large organization's procurement function whose primary goal is to leverage its enterprise reach in order to capitalize on strategic sourcing opportunities that will maximize value and savings to the organization and stakeholders.;0;;;;;
From 2010 to 2014, this organization's procurement function spent nearly $43 Billion in support of its operations.;0;;;;;
This figure represents nearly 11% of the total 2010-2014 budget of this organization.;0;;;;;
As the organization continues to face ongoing operations in multiple locations, the increased scrutiny by senior leadership to improve strategic sourcing, and the looming threat of an overburdened economy, the need to uncover areas ripe for value maximization and reduced supply chain risk cannot be overstated.;0;;;;;
Thus, this research was guided by the desire to apply the KPM strategic sourcing model to this organizational context to allow the enterprise to develop distinctive management approaches for its sourcing activities.;0;;;;;
To accomplish this the organization required an objective and quantitative approach to position items within the KPM and identify the products and services offering the highest potential for value maximization while minimizing supply chain risk through strategic sourcing.;0;;;;;
Consequently, the methodology employed is for the purpose of positioning items within the matrix and identifying optimal candidates to begin strategic sourcing initiatives.;0;;;;;
The KPM is, in essence, a multi-objective decision model.;0;;;;;
Kraljic indicates that a trade-off exists between two factors: supply risk and value impact.;0;;;;;
The location of a commodity or service within the KPM represents this trade-off.;0;;;;;
Kraljic argues that an organization can fully exploit its buying power and achieve greater value gains when supply risk is minimized and value measures are maximized.;0;;;;;
This exploitation happens when items fall within the Leverage quadrant of the KPM.;2;;;;;
On the other hand, items that fall outside of the Leverage quadrant offer less value impact or increased supply chain risk exposure to the firm and require a different approach, or strategy, for purchasing.;0;;;;;
The general idea behind the KPM is to minimize supply vulnerability and maximize value impact while at the same time matching external resources provided by suppliers with the internal needs of the buying firm.;0;;;;;
An assumption is made regarding an overall direction of preference towards the Leverage quadrant since it is in this quadrant that a purchasing organization is most likely to achieve maximum value improvements while minimizing risk exposure.;2;;;;;
Relative to the exemplar organization, the objective to minimize supply risk was interpreted as minimizing supply market complexity.;3;;;;;
Risk, according to literature, is restricted to situations in which both the set of possibilities and the probability distribution over this set are known whereas decisions under uncertainty are usually made on grounds other than logical calculation.;0;;;;;
Kraljic uses the term risk to identify a supply market that is comprised of many factors that affect its complexity rather than outcomes with an associated probability and consequence.;0;;;;;
Parnell add that risk neutrality is often seen in Government and non-profit decision making.;0;;;;;
Therefore, we narrow our focus to a risk-less model with a fundamental objective to Minimize Supply Market Complexity.;0;;;;;
This also serves to simplify the model by eliminating the requirement to incorporate risk attitude.;0;;;;;
Furthermore, for the objective to maximize value, the exemplar organization sought to Maximize Strategic Impact.;0;;;;;
The ability of an organization to carry out its particular operations and processes is critical to the success of the organizations strategy and the centralized purchasing function of the organization providing the data for this research is pivotal to the strategic success of its various locations.;0;;;;;
Thus, for the exemplar organization the fundamental objectives decision-makers were focused on included.;0;;;;;
Within the exemplar organization, individual products and services acquired are referred to as Product and Service Codes.;0;;;;;
Given the two fundamental objectives and their respective direction of preference, Multi-Objective Decision Analysis is implemented as a framework to quantitatively position PSCs within the KPM.;0;;;;;
We recall that the terms minimize and maximize connotes the direction of preference of the decision maker for a particular objective.;0;;;;;
In our case, a less complex supply market is preferred over a more com- plex supply market and higher strategic impact is preferred over less strategic impact.;0;;;;;
No manipulation of the market or the organization's strategy is required or intended when positioning a PSC.;0;;;;;
However, the direction of preference is a requirement when using MODA and is vital to our methodology as will be seen in the following sections.;0;;;;;
The alternatives for this research are simply the set of PSCs, or procurement items, that the organization desires to position within the KPM.;0;;;;;
Although there are 1702 PSCs involved in contracts, the organization supplied a subset of PSCs for this analysis that accounts for 80% of 2010Ð2014 spend.;0;;;;;
Specifically, we seek to position 138 PSCs selected by the organization.;0;;;;;
Supply market complexity can be measured by various attributes such as market structure, concentration, risk, and price trends.;0;;;;;
To capture these characteristics of a market, organizations can develop internal algorithms to measure and aggregate this information or leverage external approaches.;0;;;;;
IBISWorld is a research organization whose reports delve into supply markets for a particular good or service.;0;;;;;
The Score is comprised of three components: price trends, market structure, and market risk.;0;;;;;
Each consists of factors such as availability of substitutes, market share concentration, and product specialization.;0;;;;;
Switching costs are also considered.;0;;;;;
These factors are weighted, scored, and aggregated to produce an overall buyer power score, which ranges between 1 and 5 with increments of 0.;0;;;;;
This indicates greater buyer strength and a less complex market.;2;;;;;
The current organization has used the Score metric for several years to monitor the complexity of its supply market.;0;;;;;
The organization obtains IBISWorld reports for each PSC as part of their market research efforts.;0;;;;;
Let X be the IBISWorld Buyer Power Score, which represents our measure of supply market complexity.;0;;;;;
A value function for this attribute provides a value score.;0;;;;;
A single attribute value function is all that is required since a single attribute was identified to measure this fundamental objective.;0;;;;;
Kirkwood identified two possible SAVFs: Piecewise linear and exponential.;0;;;;;
To select the appropriate function, interviews were conducted with members of the purchasing function of the organization who are experts in strategic sourcing and have experience using the KPM.;0;;;;;
The goal of the interviews was to identify and build a value preference structure for each attribute by eliciting values using the fractile method as explained by Howard and Abbas.;0;;;;;
The Resource-based view posits that organizations achieve strategic impact through their resources.;0;;;;;
However, it has been recognized that tangible and intangible assets cannot provide competitive advantages by themselves.;0;;;;;
Hansen argue that it is not simply the possession of valuable and inimitable resources, but how leadership manages these resources is just as important.;0;;;;;
Thus, the ability of a manager to orchestrate its resources is fundamental to executing the organization's strategic objectives and achieving competitive advantage.;0;;;;;
Unfortunately, in many large bureaucratic enterprises, government entities, and non-profit organizations, forced budget reductions remove managers  control of resource orchestration.;0;;;;;
In fact, peanut butter spread reductions are often made where all units and functions experience a common reduction.;0;;;;;
Yet in times of budget increases, managers across the organizational hierarchies are free, to an extent, to exercise judgment in purchasing decisions to align resources with strategic objectives.;0;;;;;
Thus, in times of normal or increasing budget activities, managers will direct their spend activities towards those resources they believe will have the largest strategic impact to their specific mission.;0;;;;;
In conversations with senior leadership from our exemplar organization, which is a large bureaucratic enterprise, this practice was considered the norm.;0;;;;;
Furthermore, in our conversations with senior leadership and management at various levels within the organization, it was commonly discussed that managers applied budget increases first to the organization's most strategically critical goods and services.;0;;;;;
Thus, in coordination with management, we leverage this finding to deduce which PSCs were most critical to the organization by identifying those PSCs that experienced the largest post-budget-cut rebound in spend.;0;;;;;
To do so, we targeted the change in spend from 2013 to 2014.;0;;;;;
Spend data from the organization shows that 2013 included significant budget cuts of approximately 13%.;0;;;;;
However, the 2014 budgets for spend increased by nearly 6%.;0;;;;;
This trend was visible at the most aggregate levels down to the most disaggregated levels.;0;;;;;
Consequently, as 2014 budgets increased, we identified those PSCs that experienced the largest post-budget-cut rebound in spend.;0;;;;;
To do so, we calculate the percent change of spend for each PSC from 2013 to 2014.;0;;;;;
We also calculate overall organization spend over the same period, compute the deviation between the two, and scaled from 0 to 1.;0;;;;;
Therefore, let Y be the delta between the overall organization spend slope and PSC spend slope from 2013 to 2014.;0;;;;;
Those PSCs with values closer to one represent spend that aims to maximize strategic impact.;0;;;;;
After solving each single attribute value function, we obtain a ordered pair for each PSC.;0;;;;;
This ordered pair allows us to plot each PSC on the organization's modified KMP.;0;;;;;
The coordinate plane is also divided into 4 equal quadrants.;0;;;;;
These partitions divide the coordinate plane into the four quadrants that represent the four quadrants of the KPM.;0;;;;;
Last, we identify the weights associated with the two fundamental objectives.;0;;;;;
Given that Kraljic identifies a unique relationship between both axes of the matrix, a multilinear function must be created rather than a simple additive value model, which has been the subject of the extant literature.;0;;;;;
This allows us to capture the preference structure and relative importance between the two objectives.;0;;;;;
This is also critical in helping to understand the relative importance of each measure and its dependency on the difference between the worst and the best value points of each measure.;0;;;;;
Furthermore, as will be illustrated, we can perform sensitivity analysis on these swing weights to gain even further robustness in our preference structure trade-space.;0;;;;;
Weights associated with each attribute and their interactions are determined following Keeney and Raiffa.;0;;;;;
Next, we determine which attribute the organization prefers to swing to its best case while keeping the other attribute at its worst case and elicit its value.;0;;;;;
We then determine the value of the opposing situation, swinging the other attribute to its best case while keeping the first attribute at its worst case and elicit this value.;0;;;;;
Further investigation regarding this phenomenon discovered that the organization's selection of PSCs for analysis was based on a specific set of key performance indicators that identified what the organization considered to be the best opportunity for strategic impact.;0;;;;;
The combination of KPI score and annual spend was used to produce the prioritized list of 138 PSCs.;0;;;;;
We should expect aggressiv negotiations to see them in the Leverage quadrant.;2;;;;;
Further investigation into this set of PSCs revealed that items procured to run the organization's various locations are more often than not common goods and services of which markets exist beyond the organization's needs.;0;;;;;
Thus, we should expect to see a bulk of PSCs congregating to the left and even to the upper left of the matrix.;0;;;;;
Moreover, in Kraljic's seminal work, he used an example of a company that positioned 5000 items.;0;;;;;
Only 75, or 1.5% were positioned on the right side of the matrix.;0;;;;;
However, this initial assessment helped to confirm that the objective quantitative approach applied aligned with the organization's internal analytic processes to identify strategically important PSCs.;0;;;;;
The bulk of the PSCs are in the upper left of the Leverage quadrant, the organization should be able to leverage its buying power to maximize strategic impact while minimizing supply chain risk with these PSCs.;2;;;;;
However, the question remains of these PSCs, which should the organization focus on first to maximize strategic impact while minimizing supply chain risk?;0;;;;;
One approach to address this concern is to let the cutoff points be produced by the data rather than using the arbitrary 0.50 cutoff value.;0;;;;;
The weight associated with the Strategic quadrant represents a scenario where an item is extremely important to the mission but is only found in a very complex market.;0;;;;;
The weight associated with the Noncritical item represents an item not important to the mission yet abides in a non-complex, buyer-empowered market.;1;;;;;
Either scenario is not preferred by the organization's representatives.;0;;;;;
Value preference elicitation sessions revealed they preferred to swing attribute Y to its best while holding attribute X at its worst over the opposing situation.;0;;;;;
The value they assigned to this swing was 52%, thus wy = 0.52.;0;;;;;
The same held for the opposing situation.;0;;;;;
The non-dominated PSCs are marked accordingly with the assumption that the organization prefers to maximize the benefit of those PSCs with the largest cost impact to the organization.;0;;;;;
The non-dominated PSCs form the Pareto optimal set, or efficient frontier, of PSCs.;0;;;;;
Seven non-dominated PSCs are identified as the Pareto Optimal Set.;0;;;;;
When considering value preferences and overall spend, this set of seven represents the optimal set of PSCs for the organization to begin strategy comparisons and implement commercial best practice purchasing strategies.;0;;;;;
To assess the robustness of our results we performed sensitivity analysis on the swing weights assigned to each single attribute value function.;0;;;;;
Sensitivity analysis allows us to see the impact on the MAVF score when adjusting the weights within a given range and provides feedback regarding biases in the modeling and elicitation procedures.;0;;;;;
For every combination of weight adjustments, we consistently identified 12 of the 138 PSCs with the highest MAVF score indicating them as most likely candidates for initial strategy comparisons.;0;;;;;
In fact, four PSCs never changed position.;0;;;;;
These results strengthen the case that the underlying MODA framework is robust and that we have adequately captured the value preferences for procured goods and services.;0;;;;;
Past research supports the argument that multi-attribute utility modeling typically yields valid mathematical representations of the preferences of decision-makers.;0;;;;;
Lastly, to further examine our MODA framework, we assessed eleven PSCs that were not part of the organization's originally prioritized set of 138.;0;;;;;
8 plots these PSCs based on their respective SAVF scores.;0;;;;;
We observe two PSCs that are positioned in the Leverage quadrant.;0;;;;;
They represent a combined annual spend of nearly $25M.;0;;;;;
However, these two PSCs were not originally prioritized by the organization's internal approach to be considered for strategic sourcing initiatives.;0;;;;;
This was due to the fact that the organization's internal analysis used overall spend with their KPI scoring criteria as a means to prioritize PSCs.;0;;;;;
Although we understand the organization's desire to focus its efforts on PSCs that have large impacts on its overall budget, our analysis highlights that these prioritization criteria may result in potential missed opportunities for strategic sourcing.;0;;;;;
In fact, this discussion promotes positioning PSCs within the KPM using the MODA-framework as an effective starting point a priori to implementing the organization's usual internal analysis.;0;;;;;
A score of 0 was assigned for the supply market complexity SAVF due to IBISWorld not providing any market research for this type of service.;0;;;;;
This seems to indicate that a buyer's market may not exist.;0;;;;;
Therefore, according to our scoring criteria, we assumed this is a complex market in which to operate and the organization confirmed this assumption.;0;;;;;
Finally, after calculating the MAVF scores for these non-prioritized PSCs and including them in the Cost-Benefit Trade Space plot, we find that the Pareto Optimal Set does not change.;0;;;;;
Again, this is due to the low FY10-14 spend of the non-prioritized PSCs.;0;;;;;
We emphasize that the Leverage Quadrant is the starting point for finding PSCs with high potential for maximizing value impact while minimizing risk exposure.;2;;;;;
The KPM helps identify such PSCs.;0;;;;;
The Pareto Optimal set simply identifies which of those PSCs to select first for implementing strategic sourcing efforts.;0;;;;;
Strategic purchasing is a critical element of success for today's organization and applying a purchasing portfolio approach has become one of the dominant purchasing strategies.;0;;;;;
Moreover, Kraljic's portfolio matrix has become the fundamental structure that most purchasing portfolio strategies rely upon.;0;;;;;
However, within the extant literature, positioning products and services within the different quadrants of the KPM is primarily based on subjective judgment of the decision makers.;0;;;;;
This has left two important questions unresolved.;0;;;;;
How does a purchasing manager quantitatively and objectively position a product or service within the matrix?;0;;;;;
Which products and services should the organization focus on first when implementing a strategic sourcing initiative?;0;;;;;
The proposed approach helps to address the current gap in the KPM literature regarding the necessity to identify and apply a quantitative method to position items within the KPM.;0;;;;;
With limited applications of quantitative techniques to position items within the KPM, our method expands the objective and quantitative rigor that can accompany a KPM application.;0;;;;;
Furthermore, our approach goes beyond the quantitative positioning of product and services in the KPM, but also provides a rigorous approach to quantitatively and objectively rank-order products and services for strategic sourcing initiatives.;0;;;;;
Specifically, we introduce the use of MODA into the KPM literature base to capture the value preferences of decision makers.;0;;;;;
First, we applied a SAVF to objectively quantify the dimensions and attributes of the products and services.;0;;;;;
We then leverage swing weights and a MAVF to rank-order the products and services to identify those, which represent the most likely candidates for strategic sourcing opportunities.;0;;;;;
A cost-benefit comparison further refined this list by identifying the Pareto optimal set of products and services most conducive to strategic sourcing opportunities.;0;;;;;
A sensitivity analysis and validation set assessment was performed to ratify the robustness of our methodology.;0;;;;;
Our approach is managerial relevant since it not only improves the objectiveness, quality, and confidence of positioning products and services within the KPM matrix, but it also helps decision makers identify those products and services that are optimal candidates to begin strategic sourcing initiatives.;0;;;;;
Due to the ease of implementation, organizations can quickly implement our solution.;0;;;;;
Furthermore, by leveraging the swing weights and sensitivity analysis, procurement managers will understand how the solution space changes based on managerial preferences.;0;;;;;
This allows managers to identify those products and services that consistently appear optimal for strategic sourcing initiatives regardless of preference structure.;0;;;;;
The organization whose data was used for this research acknowledged that the objective and quantitative approach proposed and demonstrated by this research represents a simpler and faster approach than the subjective approaches advocated in the literature.;0;;;;;
The leadership also acknowledged that this approach led to higher quality and more insightful results than the approaches they had used in the past.;0;;;;;
The management team is excited about the time and effort savings that this new approach represents.;0;;;;;
They also view this approach as a way of providing objective continuity across leadership changes and between the various levels of leadership within their organization.;0;;;;;
Despite the rigor of our analysis, we accept that certain limitations exist that might entice further research.;0;;;;;
First, our analysis leverages a SAVF for each of the attributes assessed.;0;;;;;
Future research can expand this approach by incorporating MAVFs so that multiple measures could be used to value a given attribute.;0;;;;;
Moreover, future research can strive to incorporate new attributes that potentially contribute to the two dimensions.;0;;;;;
Furthermore, our research focuses on quantifying the attributes of procured products and services and indicating where strategic sourcing efforts should focus first.;0;;;;;
However, our research does not identify the appropriate procurement strategy techniques that should be applied to these identified opportunities.;0;;;;;
Future research should seek to link the results of our quantified approach to specific procurement strategies to provide decision makers with a complete purchasing portfolio framework.;0;;;;;
An additional limitation of this analysis is the lack of support for the cutoff values that produce the four KPM quadrants.;0;;;;;
Future research should analyze possible cutoff value approaches, whether they are determined from statistical properties of the data such as median, mean, standard deviations, or quantiles, and see how these change the interpretation of the results or perspective.;0;;;;;
This may provide significant insight into whether the current arbitrary 0 cutoff is reasonable or if alternative approaches are more appropriate depending on the business context.;0;;;;;
Lastly, this analysis relies on the data from a single organization.;0;;;;;
Future research should strive to replicate the approach advocated here using data from other organizations to perhaps strengthen the overall generalizability of the approach, to verify whether or not the assumptions made hold true in other contexts, and to determine whether or not the cutoff values utilized are equally applicable to other organizations.;0;;;;;
Many organizations only leverage a fraction of what could potentially be managed and saved through strategic sourcing.;0;;;;;
Strategic sourcing even one additional percent of the spend of large organizations could equate to billions of dollars of value improvement.;0;;;;;
Implementing strategic sourcing via a purchasing portfolio framework, organizations have the opportunity to more aggressively leverage their buying power and select appropriate sourcing strategies and tactics.;0;;;;;
With Kraljic's portfolio matrix being the most widely used diagnostic and prescriptive purchasing portfolio framework, this research greatly contributes to this framework by providing a more quantitative and rigorously grounded matrix.;0;;;;;
This provides purchasing managers an objective, quantitative approach to identify products and services ripe for strategic sourcing initiatives.;0;;;;;
Recently, purchasing portfolio models have received considerable attention from academic and business world.;0;;;;;
Obviously, not all products and not all buyer-supplier relationships are to be managed in the same way.;0;;;;;
In general, purchasing portfolio models aim at developing differentiated purchasing and supplier strategies.;0;;;;;
Kraljic introduced the first comprehensive portfolio approach for purchasing and supply management.;0;;;;;
Kraljic s approach includes the construction of a portfolio matrix that classifies products on the basis of two dimensions.;0;;;;;
The result is a matrix and a classification in four categories.;0;;;;;
These products are hard to get, since there are only a few sources. ;3;;;;;
These unimportant items are non-critical for purchasing.;1;;;;;
Leverage items can be sourced from many different suppliers.;2;;;;;
Strategic items are often developed by supplier and buyer in collaboration.;4;;;;;
Each of the four categories requires a distinctive approach towards suppliers.;0;;;;;
Non-critical items require efficient processing, product standardization, order volume and inventory optimalization.;1;;;;;
Leverage items allow the buying company to exploit its full purchasing power, for instance through tendering, target pricing and product substitution.;2;;;;;
Bottleneck items cause significant problems and risks which should be handled by volume insurance, vendor control, security of inventories and backup plans.;3;;;;;
A further analysis of the strategic items is recommended.;4;;;;;
By plotting the buying strengths against the strengths of the supply market, three basic power positions are identified and associated with three different supplier strategies.;0;;;;;
Exploit the buyer power.;2;;;;;
Diversify the supply base in order to secure supply of scarce components.;3;;;;;
The general idea of Kraljic s model is to minimize supply risk and make the most of buying power.;0;;;;;
Although other models have been developed, Kraljic s approach subsequently became the dominant approach to what the profession regards as operational professionalism.;0;;;;;
Lamming confirmed that Kraljic s matrix remains the foundation of purchasing strategy for many organizations across different sectors.;0;;;;;
Purchasing portfolio models have gained ground in both academic research as well as in practice.;0;;;;;
In the course of time, the Kraljic approach has entered many textbooks on purchasing and supply management.;0;;;;;
In contrast with a growing acceptance and use of purchasing portfolio models, there are problems and unanswered questions.;0;;;;;
In general, decisions based on portfolio models are proven to be sensitive to the choice of dimensions, factors, and weights.;0;;;;;
Day concluded that measurement is considered to be the Achilles heel for all portfolio models.;0;;;;;
What is exactly meant by profit impact and supply risk?;0;;;;;
How could or should we measure these dimensions in practice?;0;;;;;
Nellore pointed at the risk that the variables used in portfolio analysis might not be accurate proxies for the dimensions they are supposed to measure.;0;;;;;
Theory does not provide prescriptions or procedures for measurement, leading Ramsay to conclude that these concepts are actually made up of a number of nebulous concepts without operational dimensions.;0;;;;;
He emphasized that the weighting of each factor is the most important part of the implementation process, but at the same time very subjective.;0;;;;;
The decision-makers must come to an agreement on the relative importance of each factor.;0;;;;;
Besides that, there are usually demarcation problems with respect to the measurement of key variables.;0;;;;;
What is an indicator for high supply risk?;3;;;;;
If we have problems discriminating between categories, then the classification of products will be arbitrary and so will be the provided recommendations.;0;;;;;
They concluded that recommendations should be applied with reserve, especially if a product is positioned near a demarcation line.;0;;;;;
Organizations should determine their own criteria and their own specific threshold values.;0;;;;;
The introduction of the Kraljic portfolio approach can be considered as a major breakthrough in the development of professional purchasing.;0;;;;;
He concluded that Kraljic s approach represents the most important single diagnostic and prescriptive tool available to purchasing and supply management.;0;;;;;
However, others find the Kraljic approach counter-productive.;0;;;;;
Providing recommendations either to exploit power.;2;;;;;
Or to avoid risk associated with the supplier exercising power.;3;;;;;
It is argued that the complexity of business decisions does not allow for simple recommendations.;0;;;;;
How could one deduce strategies from a portfolio analysis that is based on just two dimensions?;0;;;;;
In addition, several authors have described and presented similar portfolio models, be it from a rather normative and deterministic perspective: one overall purchasing strategy for each cell/category.;0;;;;;
It might be assumed that all strategic items should be managed by means of strategic partnerships.;4;;;;;
Often, the suppliers side of the buyer-seller relationship is considered as a disregarded element in Kraljic s model.;0;;;;;
The Kraljic approach does not explicitly take into account the possible strategies and reactions of suppliers.;0;;;;;
In a critical review of the Kraljic approach, argued that purchasing portfolio models using given products as a point of departure, in addition to a dyadic perspective, may be counterproductive where purchasing efficiency is concerned.;0;;;;;
He confirmed that it is imperative for any portfolio use to indicate the characteristics of the supplier with regard to the specification generation, the required relationship and the required type of specification for a given component.;0;;;;;
The design of a product entails issues that are not explicitly considered in portfolio models.;0;;;;;
Whether the product is developed by the supplier, the customer or developed jointly impacts on the relationships between parties.;4;;;;;
Mismatches between buyer and seller are likely to occur if one does not take into account how a supplier assesses the situation.;0;;;;;
A partnership is only possible if that is the strategic intent of both parties.;4;;;;;
Joint interests are very important for a partnership.;4;;;;;
Organizations must match their joint intentions and strategies.;4;;;;;
He stated that strategies that are solely based on Kraljic s matrix lack the dynamics of the power that the supplier can obtain.;0;;;;;
They pointed at the natural conflict of interests in buyer-supplier relationships.;0;;;;;
As a result, positions in the Kraljic matrices will always be amendable to the dynamics of buyer/seller relationships.;0;;;;;
Parties are inclined to seek for possibilities of influencing their relative power position.;0;;;;;
Cox explicitly posited that a sufficient condition of success would be the ability to find ways to move from current positions of power to other more favourable positions.;0;;;;;
The Kraljic framework, however, does not provide guidelines for movements within the matrix.;0;;;;;
It is not clear if and how other positions in the matrix are to be pursued through the implementation of the recommended strategies.;0;;;;;
Under which conditions would it be advisable and feasible to pursue movements in the matrix?;0;;;;;
How should those movements be accomplished?;0;;;;;
So far, we have discussed a number of issues and unanswered question with respect to Kraljic s portfolio approach.;0;;;;;
This critique of Kraljic, however, does not include the experience of practitioners.;0;;;;;
How do purchasing professionals handle such issues in practice?;0;;;;;
In general, what could we learn from their experience?;0;;;;;
Little is known about the actual use of portfolio models in purchasing.;0;;;;;
Most publications are conceptual or anecdotal by nature.;0;;;;;
This empirical study addresses the gap between the conceptual problems and the actual employment of purchasing portfolio models.;0;;;;;
The cases studies clarify the handling of measurement and strategic issues by experienced professionals.;0;;;;;
The main objective of the case studies is to identify and to describe advanced current practices with respect to purchasing portfolio models.;0;;;;;
The cases studies are aimed at answering the following set of research questions.;0;;;;;
Considering the unclear guidelines and the unanswered questions with respect to the measurement of dimensions in purchasing portfolio analysis, how are these issues handled to the satisfaction of experienced purchasing professionals?;0;;;;;
What kind of objectives and strategies are applicable, using Kraljic s portfolio matrix?;0;;;;;
What kind of movements are considered in the Kraljic matrix, in terms of current positions, future positions and strategies?;0;;;;;
Three in-depth case studies were conducted, involving Dutch industrial firms.;0;;;;;
The case companies were selected on their experience with the use of a purchasing portfolio approach.;0;;;;;
A selective, non-random sample is in line with the exploratory nature of the research questions at hand.;0;;;;;
Naturally, the composition of the sample is not made with the aim of being statistically representative of a population.;0;;;;;
Because we wanted to explore different possibilities of the portfolio approaches, different units of analysis were included.;0;;;;;
The first case study dealt with the use of a portfolio approach on the corporate level of the company, aimed at synergy and leverage across business units.;0;;;;;
The second case company is a large, global business area with plants all over the world.;0;;;;;
In more than 30 countries comparable portfolio analyses are performed for the different sub-business units.;0;;;;;
The portfolio analysis concerns the procurement of ingredients, to be used in the end product, coatings.;0;;;;;
The third case is performed at the business unit level as well.;0;;;;;
However, the business context differs to a large extent.;0;;;;;
It is a fairly small, basically national manufacturer of technologically advanced modules.;0;;;;;
The importance of the limited number of customers is omnipresent.;0;;;;;
As a first-tier supplier, it performs the portfolio analysis for each major customer separately.;0;;;;;
All items are positioned that are used for the production of the custom-made product for a specific customer.;0;;;;;
Obviously, there is a different business context for the three cases.;0;;;;;
Appendix A summarizes the main situational factors that describe the most notable case specific circumstances.;0;;;;;
Data were collected primarily through semi-structured interviews and secondary resources, such as internet web sites, annual reports, internal reports, and purchasing plans.;0;;;;;
A total number of 28 interviews were conducted.;0;;;;;
The case studies entailed the use of a key-informant method, interviewing a selected, limited number of participants.;0;;;;;
Informants were all chosen for their specialized knowledge of and experience with the use of portfolio models in real-life purchasing, notably business unit managers, purchasing managers and senior buyers (judgement sample).;0;;;;;
From the various scopes of the case studies, it can be concluded that a purchasing portfolio approach can be applied on many different levels of aggregation.;0;;;;;
The generic nature of the Kralic approach allows for customization, implying that users have to make all kinds of decisions, implementing the portfolio analysis.;0;;;;;
We have found that measurement issues and strategic issues are handled in different ways.;0;;;;;
Some of the differences can be explained by differences of scale, scope, value proposition and supply chain position.;0;;;;;
The conditions on end markets, the requirements of customers, and the overall business strategy were found to be significant circumstances for the selection of purchasing and supplier strategies.;0;;;;;
The case studies illustrate differences in use frequency, occasion, and purpose.;0;;;;;
In every company a champion could be found, introducing and supporting the portfolio analysis.;0;;;;;
In our case studies, these product champions were the highest purchasing professionals in the organization.;0;;;;;
It should be noted that performing a portfolio analysis means teamwork.;0;;;;;
The views of colleagues from different fields of expertise should be added to the more functional purchasing perspective.;0;;;;;
For a designer replaceability might be important, while the production manager might focus on risk of failure.;0;;;;;
For reasons of support and implementation, a cross-functional team is required, with representatives from all relevant departments and specialist fields.;0;;;;;
It summarizes some of the most significant characteristics of the investigated portfolio approaches, examining use issues and measurement issues.;0;;;;;
It was found that in all investigated case studies, the positioning of items (the measurement) was followed by a process of reviewing the positions in the matrix and a process of reflection on the consequences.;0;;;;;
Whatever method is selected, there are always subjective choices, limitations and elements that influence the actual positioning in the matrix.;0;;;;;
On closer consideration, questions have always to be answered for each position that is found in the matrix.;0;;;;;
Where are points of intervention?;0;;;;;
In other words, after the matrix is filled, users reflect on the results.;0;;;;;
If necessary, manual adjustments are made.;0;;;;;
In-depth discussions on the positions in the matrix are considered as the most important phase of the analysis.;0;;;;;
Strategic discussions provide deeper insights and may lead more easily to consensus-based decisions.;0;;;;;
It is felt by the users that the Kraljic framework facilitates these important discussions to a large extent.;0;;;;;
The first research question of this study refers to measurement problems, associated with the use of a portfolio approach: how do experienced professionals handle issues with respect to the measurement of dimensions and factors?;0;;;;;
This question will be answered, by describing the solutions developed by different professionals.;0;;;;;
The case studies identified three kinds of different approaches to the measurement issues, connected to every purchasing portfolio analysis.;0;;;;;
We found a close connection between the measurement method and the handling of the demarcation problem.;0;;;;;
The measurement methods also specified other measurement issues, such as the selection of dimensions and the determination of weights and scores.;0;;;;;
The consensus method is predominantly based on a process of reasoning and discussing.;0;;;;;
The reaching of consensus is very important when choices are made with respect to the measurement of variables and factors, and ultimately for the positioning of product in the matrix.;0;;;;;
Advocates of this approach regard this as a very attractive feature of the portfolio analysis that is being used.;0;;;;;
Profound, open discussions about purchasing issues are considered as the most critical part of strategy development.;0;;;;;
Differences of opinions become very clear, allowing for a true strategic discussion.;0;;;;;
As a rule, points of view always have to be substantiated by facts.;0;;;;;
DSM uses this consensus method for years.;0;;;;;
Users are content with the flexibility and possibilities of this consensus-based approach.;0;;;;;
Just one key variable is selected per dimension.;0;;;;;
The financial value of items comes very close to the profit impact, the supply risk is usually operationalized by the number of suppliers.;0;;;;;
As a result, positions in the matrix can be determined in a rather quick and unambiguous way.;0;;;;;
The one-by-one method is quite popular with purchasing professionals.;0;;;;;
The user does not need an advanced information system that includes quantitative or quantifiable data on a set of factors.;0;;;;;
A related benefit is that it allows for the comparison of different matrices that use the same variables.;0;;;;;
In addition, the method allows identifying to what extent products can shift to another quadrant.;0;;;;;
A product is a raw material that is only available from one mine in the world, owned by one supplier.;3;;;;;
A product is a raw material of which the buying company requires its specifications to meet extremely high-quality elements.;4;;;;;
Obviously, products A and B will be positioned in the strategic quadrant.;0;;;;;
Product could be moved towards the leverage quadrant, provided that its specification would be defined less strict, which opens the market to more supplier.;2;;;;;
In other words, additional background information is needed on products, markets and suppliers, in order to avoid that opportunities or threats might be neglected.;0;;;;;
It uses a weighted factor score method that includes a number of factors for each dimension.;0;;;;;
The method allows for a completely customized approach, deciding on factors, weights, and scores.;0;;;;;
Total scores per dimension are calculated in an additive model.;0;;;;;
Through the multiplication of scores and weights, the sub-scores are added to a single value.;0;;;;;
Implicitly, it is assumed that a lower score on a factor can be compensated by a higher score on another factor.;0;;;;;
The user of an additive model should ask himself if this is an acceptable line of reasoning.;0;;;;;
If there is just a single supplier delivering a certain product, then there is a maximal dependence on this supplier.;3;;;;;
Would it be possible that the resulting supply risk is compensated by other factors?;0;;;;;
Depending on the level of aggregation, it could be necessary to dispose of a large number of quantitative data that are rarely available in a purchasing information system.;0;;;;;
Working with constituent factors, the overall picture can be hard to see, especially when dealing with large number of factors and weights.;0;;;;;
On the other hand, the portfolio analysis can be fully customized, according to one s own views and requirements.;0;;;;;
All relevant factors can be included in the analysis.;0;;;;;
It provides an overview of the main differences between these three measurement methods.;0;;;;;
The decision on the measurement method can be based on the following selection criteria, which are derived from the specific advantages and disadvantage of the methods.;0;;;;;
The required objectiveness, number of key factors, available time, needed customization and flexibility.;0;;;;;
The investigated cases made clear that the development of portfolio-based strategies requires additional information.;0;;;;;
In all case studies, it was found that additional information has been included in the portfolio analysis.;0;;;;;
The business strategy of them focuses on technological innovations, as first tier supplier.;0;;;;;
Purchasing and supply have to connect with these basic principles, partnering key suppliers for early involvement in product development and product improvement.;4;;;;;
The basic points of departure of it are for instance rather different, a firm that operates from an operational excellence perspective, always looking for cost reductions and efficiency.;0;;;;;
The marketing requirements on end markets are clearly translated by them in guidelines for the development of purchasing strategies.;0;;;;;
Commodity markets are distinguished from niche markets, which affect the selection of purchasing objectives and strategies to a considerable extent.;0;;;;;
Obviously, the purchasing professional will take into account the situations on specific supply markets and the assessments of individual suppliers.;0;;;;;
Items with high supply risks will be treated differently, according to the reliability, the performance, the competences, and the intentions of the connected suppliers.;3;;;;;
The second research question of this study refers to the objectives and strategies.;0;;;;;
The research revealed three levels of portfolio-based objectives: the item level, the category level, and the matrix level.;0;;;;;
In all of the three investigated cases, objectives were formulated at the item level.;0;;;;;
On a category level, objectives can be formulated for the four quadrants.;0;;;;;
Finally, it is possible to make statements on the matrix level.;0;;;;;
Optimization of order volumes and inventories is key.;1;;;;;
The non-critical categories should be as empty as possible, by means of standardization and pooling of requirements.;1;;;;;
The leverage category should be filled with partners of convenience, meeting key success factors of business units.;2;;;;;
The strategic category should only include strategic partners, with the proper capabilities for co-design.;4;;;;;
They use an even more sophisticated system of developing portfolio-based objectives.;0;;;;;
For each area business unit the whole matrix is assessed, mainly based on the situations on their end markets.;0;;;;;
Niche markets require high-quality ingredients, which can be achieved by joint actions.;4;;;;;
A logical consequence is that the strategic quadrant will be filled with a relatively large number of key suppliers, with whom close relationships are maintained.;4;;;;;
The case studies clarified the selection of portfolio-based strategies for the four categories, which bring us to the question of how to find common ground between those different kinds of strategies.;0;;;;;
At first sight, we concluded that they were incomparable.;0;;;;;
However, taking a closer look and taking up a higher level of abstraction, we did found some striking similarities, in spite of the differences in the level of the investigated cases.;0;;;;;
The strategies and their conditions usually refer to possibilities to reduce the dependence on a supplier and to possibilities to increase buying power.;2;;;;;
The third research question explicitly refers to possibilities of moving in the matrix.;0;;;;;
The case studies revealed that, additionally to Kraljic s theory, experienced practitioners were very aware of the different choices within each quadrant.;0;;;;;
Based on the interviews and the overview of selected strategies, we have concluded that for each category two different kinds of strategic directions can be distinguished.;0;;;;;
Holding on to a position implicitly means that current circumstances are taken for granted.;0;;;;;
We have observed that a position in the matrix can be accepted for different reasons, sometimes positive, sometimes referring to a negative choice.;0;;;;;
A position might be preferred because a firm is convinced that it is the best position for a certain item.;0;;;;;
In other cases a position might be accepted, because there are no realistic possibilities for change.;0;;;;;
The first type of strategies are of a more active, radical nature.;0;;;;;
When possible and desirable, other positions in the matrix are identified and pursued.;0;;;;;
This dichotomy between holding position and moving to another position has laid the foundation of the conceptual model of strategic directions in the Kraljic-Matrix.;0;;;;;
If we take a look at the bottleneck, those movements are pursued that reduce the supply risk.;3;;;;;
In terms of the matrix, this means moving to the left.;0;;;;;
Non-critical items are moved easily.;1;;;;;
Leverage positions could be exploited by the more dominant buyer.;2;;;;;
We will elaborate the strategic directions that can be identified in the conceptual model.;0;;;;;
In bottleneck scenarios, it is recommended to decomplex the product and find new suppliers.;3;;;;;
Bottleneck items are by definition of low value and of high risk.;3;;;;;
It should be interesting enough, especially from an economic point of view, to search for other solutions.;3;;;;;
Broadening specifications or decomplex to the supplier.;3;;;;;
This means a shift towards the non-critical quadrant.;1;;;;;
Accept the dependence on a supplier, assure the supply of the product.;3;;;;;
If no other options are feasible, then the category remains the same.;0;;;;;
A response to unfavourable bottleneck positions is contingency planning in combination with risk analysis.;3;;;;;
Common responses to unfavourable bottleneck positions is consignment systems, long-term contracting with an emphasis on quality and assurance of supply.;3;;;;;
A response to unfavourable bottleneck positions is ultimately keeping stocks.;3;;;;;
Non-critical items should be sourced by pooling of requirements.;1;;;;;
Non-critical items are put together in large quantities, increasing the buying power of the firm.;1;;;;;
If necessary, a process of standardization is pursued.;1;;;;;
The pooling strategy is executed by a framework agreement with a preferred supplier, systems contracting, a Vendor Managed Inventory system, or an e-procurement solution.;1;;;;;
Individual ordering, efficient processing.;2;;;;;
Whenever it is not possible to pool the purchasing requirements, the remaining option is some type of individual ordering, for instance by means of a purchase card.;1;;;;;
The purchasing strategy is aimed at reducing the indirect purchasing costs which are connected with administrative activities.;1;;;;;
Leverage items include exploiting buying power.;2;;;;;
The generally preferred leverage position can be used for a rather aggressive supplier management.;2;;;;;
Competitive bidding and short-term contracts are feasible options to exploit the leverage position.;2;;;;;
The dominant power position allows for a command strategy.;2;;;;;
Leverage suppliers are aptly referred to as partners of convenience.;2;;;;;
Develop a strategic partnership to gain joint benefits.;4;;;;;
The goal is the search for a more strategic partnership with a supplier.;4;;;;;
A cooperative strategy is only pursued, if the supplier involved is willing and capable of contributing to the competitive advantage of the firm.;4;;;;;
Such a new role is only feasible for technologically advanced suppliers.;4;;;;;
The case studies revealed that the move from leverage positions are usually not given up.;2;;;;;
Strategic items can be sourced by maintaining a strategic partnership.;4;;;;;
Long-term relationships with key suppliers should always contribute to the competitive advantage of the firm.;4;;;;;
Such relationships include mutual trust, mutual commitment, and an open exchange of information.;4;;;;;
A successful partnership can be very valuable for both parties.;4;;;;;
Accept a locked-in partnership with both suppliers and buyers commited.;4;;;;;
A position in the quadrant may be due to unchosen, unfavourable conditions.;3;;;;;
The resulting locked-in situation is commonly caused by a patent position, a monopoly position, high switching costs, asset specificity or by the directions of a major customer.;4;;;;;
This may start a painful process of reducing the dependence on the supplier involved.;3;;;;;
With these generic descriptions of purchasing strategies, based on portfolio analysis, we have answered the third research question: what kinds of movements are considered in the Kraljic matrix?;0;;;;;
We have filtered and analysed the responses in the interviews and summarized the findings.;0;;;;;
The case studies departed from the contention that we needed to gain a better understanding of how purchasing portfolio models are being used in practice and how they could be used by purchasing professionals in order to pursue effective differentiated purchasing strategies.;0;;;;;
Publications have identified a number of problems and unanswered questions, but they do not reveal how purchasing professionals actually handle those issues.;0;;;;;
This study has clarified these issues, describing advanced practices with respect to purchasing portfolio models.;0;;;;;
The research questions referred to measurement issues and portfolio-based strategies.;0;;;;;
The investigated cases provided useful insights in the possibilities and actual employment of purchasing portfolio analysis.;0;;;;;
Each method satisfies the needs and expectations of the different users.;0;;;;;
The reason for this can be found in the additional steps that have to be taken in the portfolio analysis.;0;;;;;
Before strategic actions are determined, it is imperative to complete a further process of interpreting and reflecting on the results.;0;;;;;
The filling of a matrix should be considered as the starting point of portfolio analysis, definitely not the finishing point.;0;;;;;
After the matrix is filled, it is imperative that users reflect on the results.;0;;;;;
If necessary, manual adjustments should be made.;0;;;;;
In-depth discussions on the positions in the matrix are considered as the most important phase of the analysis.;0;;;;;
Strategic discussions provide deeper insights and may lead more easily to consensus-based decisions.;0;;;;;
It is felt by the users that the Kraljic framework facilitates these important discussions to a large extent.;0;;;;;
Some argue that the complexity of business decisions does not allow for simple recommendations.;0;;;;;
How could one deduce strategies from a portfolio analysis that is based on just two basic dimensions?;0;;;;;
Actually, the answer is simple: one cannot!;0;;;;;
The supplier s side should be included in any strategic thinking on the field of purchasing and supply management.;0;;;;;
Practitioners have found a reply to the critique of the Kraljic approach, which stated that the supplier s side is a disregarded element in Kraljic s model.;0;;;;;
The selection of portfolio-based purchasing strategies was explored as well.;0;;;;;
Based on the case studies, a conceptual model of strategic directions has been presented, providing insights and overview of the main strategic choices for the categories in the matrix.;0;;;;;
In addition to Kraljic s strategic recommendations, different kinds of strategic responses were identified and described for each item category.;0;;;;;
At the right side of the matrix, movements are pursued in order to reduce a high level of supply risk.;3;;;;;
In terms of the matrix, this means moving to the left.;0;;;;;
Non-critical items are preferably sourced in a standardized way.;1;;;;;
These are the most common movements within the matrix.;0;;;;;
We have described and discussed the critique of Kraljic s model.;0;;;;;
The research findings indicate that experienced practitioners have found effective solutions to these problems.;0;;;;;
We must conclude that the portfolio approach is very helpful in positioning commodities in the different segments and in developing differentiated purchasing strategies.;0;;;;;
However, we should bear in mind that there is no simple, standardized blue print for the application of the portfolio analysis.;0;;;;;
It requires critical thinking and sophistication of purchasing management.;0;;;;;
Although the findings are based on a limited number of case studies, the authors feel that the study has contributed to a better assessment of the critique on Kraljic s model and to a better understanding of the possibilities of a purchasing portfolio approach in practice.;0;;;;;
Portfolio models have received considerable attention in the recent literature about professional purchasing.;0;;;;;
The best known portfolio model was introduced by Kraljic.;0;;;;;
According to Kraljic a firm s supply strategy depends on two factors.;0;;;;;
His model has had a broad influence on professional purchasing.;0;;;;;
Kraljic s seminal paper has started a stream of conceptual and empirical research on the use and possibilities of a portfolio approach in purchasing.;0;;;;;
Other scholars have introduced variations of the original Kraljic matrix.;0;;;;;
The resulting matrices are quite similar to the Kraljic matrix in that they employ comparable dimensions and derive largely equivalent recommendations.;0;;;;;
With the help of this matrix, professional purchasers can differentiate between the various supplier relations and choose strategies that are appropriate for each category and thereby effectively manage suppliers.;0;;;;;
The introduction of the Kraljic matrix has inspired academic authors to undertake further research into portfolio models, such as issues of power and dependence, purchasing portfolio usage and purchasing sophistication, the dynamic nature of purchasing strategies in the matrix, web-based the procurement of MRO-items, the link to the specification process, supplier development in product development.;0;;;;;
However, as mentioned previously, the reported use of portfolio models within an international environment is scarce.;0;;;;;
Given the added complexity of international sourcing and the established effectiveness of portfolio models to reduce complexity, an explorative study is desired.;0;;;;;
Akzo Nobel Coatings works with price indices for raw materials.;0;;;;;
Every year purchasing plans are developed, including specific goals for specific product categories.;0;;;;;
Targets and goals are formulated in terms of these indices.;0;;;;;
A critical benchmark concerns the prices that are being paid by competitors.;0;;;;;
Akzo Nobel Coatings demands prices below the ones that are paid by its competitors.;0;;;;;
Akzo Nobel Coatings operates on a lower and later principle.;0;;;;;
It wants prices that are lower than the prices paid by competitors, and in case of a price increase it wants to be subject to that rise at a later point in time.;0;;;;;
They are hesitant about being dependent on suppliers.;3;;;;;
Dependence costs money, is the general conviction.;3;;;;;
The positioning in its end markets are an important consideration in creating a logical fit between purchasing strategies and marketing strategies.;0;;;;;
From a global sourcing perspective the use of the purchasing portfolio tool is a good example of the management of internal interfaces within business units.;0;;;;;
In a commodity market, it must deal with low margins and large quantities in aggressive, competitive markets.;0;;;;;
Specifications are general, resulting in flexibility in switching from one supplier to another.;2;;;;;
Contracts are on a short-term basis, price negotiations are tough, and the logistic demands on the suppliers are high.;2;;;;;
In its niche markets, Akzo Nobel Coatings exacts relatively high margins.;0;;;;;
The delivery times and high quality are the main selling points.;0;;;;;
As a result, these are important criteria for suppliers, too.;0;;;;;
High product quality in end markets requires high-quality ingredients.;0;;;;;
In return, high margins in end markets allow for expensive raw materials.;0;;;;;
We are engaged in close relationships with suppliers.;4;;;;;
Switching costs are relatively high.;4;;;;;
Purchasing s job is to maintain the required quality.;0;;;;;
The R&D department is involved in product improvement and is guarding the company s technological edge.;0;;;;;
What is the added value of this supplier to our company?;4;;;;;
They are expected to perform in the areas of product quality, reliability of delivery, price, technical capabilities, and general management.;0;;;;;
In return, Akzo Nobel Coatings receives volume discounts.;0;;;;;
Preferred suppliers are expected to have production facilities in several countries, close to their plants.;0;;;;;
The purchasing managers at Akzo Nobel Decorating Coatings consider the portfolio analysis as an indispensable tool to determine purchasing strategies, differentiated to products and suppliers.;0;;;;;
The portfolio analysis is used to indicate the importance of a raw material and its suppliers, and to measure the purchasing value.;0;;;;;
The analysis results in an overview of the own strengths and weaknesses in purchasing markets.;0;;;;;
The main purpose of the portfolio approach is to detect products or product groups that cause problems and risks of dependence.;0;;;;;
The outcome of the portfolio analysis signals the problems and products that need to be tackled, and with which priority.;0;;;;;
It focuses on the goals and directions of purchasing strategies, and the efforts of R&D departments in their search for alternative solutions.;0;;;;;
In addition, the purchasing portfolio provides insights into the balance of power: it is of critical importance to recognize and formulate questions with respect to negotiation possibilities.;0;;;;;
The portfolio matrix is completed on the level of individual plants.;0;;;;;
For every plant portfolio analyses are performed on a yearly basis.;0;;;;;
Portfolio analyses must be performed in accordance with the strict guidelines, on how to measure dimensions and how to position items in the matrix.;0;;;;;
The results of the portfolio analyses are sent from the individual plants to headquarters, for standardization and coordination purposes within the business unit.;0;;;;;
The feedback from headquarters includes specific targets for materials in the quadrants of the matrix.;0;;;;;
A related target could be that the value of all leverage purchases are related to buyer power.;2;;;;;
The matrices of the different country units are not combined into one joint purchasing portfolio matrix.;0;;;;;
This lack of integration is understandable, considering the differences in local situations and the intended and actual use of the portfolio tool.;0;;;;;
Local situations are incomparable with respect to the chemical composition of coatings.;0;;;;;
An ingredient of coating A may easily be replaced by another, while the same ingredient in coating B can not be replaced by any other ingredient.;0;;;;;
There is a diversity of significance of the same ingredient for different coatings.;0;;;;;
Coordinated sourcing is organized by the lead buying system and to a lesser extent by the main buying system.;0;;;;;
The local buying system for the worldwide plants is being controlled and standardized by the strict guidelines on how to use the portfolio analysis at plant level.;0;;;;;
It uses a customized version of the Kraljic portfolio approach.;0;;;;;
All raw materials are categorized into four cells, based on the two axes: the number of suppliers, and the value of purchases.;0;;;;;
The number of suppliers is defined as the number of suppliers that are actually used in the last year for the same item.;0;;;;;
The value of purchases is measured in money, reflecting the price and the volume of a raw material.;0;;;;;
The demarcation line between high and low is based.;0;;;;;
This means that the upper half of the matrix contains all purchases that add the total purchase value, while the lower half of the matrix holds the remaining.;0;;;;;
Any portfolio is seen from the perspective of the individual users.;0;;;;;
Therefore, the demarcation line is drawn from the user s perspective.;0;;;;;
The value of purchases is a relative concept, to be considered from the individual perspective of the local plant.;0;;;;;
The procurement of 5000 tons for a small plant could be positioned as a high value of purchases, while 30,000 tons of the same commodity for a larger plant could be seen as a low value of purchases.;0;;;;;
Otherwise, small plants would only have positions in the lower regions of the matrix.;0;;;;;
The completion of the matrix cannot be completed by the local purchasing manager alone.;0;;;;;
It requires the input of technical and chemical experts who provide their expert knowledge of formulas, preparation methods and the properties of chemical products and materials.;0;;;;;
The users of raw materials in the plants have information regarding annual use figures, while financial management provides information regarding the total value.;0;;;;;
Based on the situations and conditions on the marketing and sales side, purchasing strategies are focused on handling costs and strategic vulnerability.;3;;;;;
Targets are determined for each product category in each quadrant, dealing with these issues.;0;;;;;
This percentage can be interpreted as high interdependence on suppliers, which is justified only in case of niche markets for the end products.;4;;;;;
For commodity markets, a misfit would exist between the actual and expected segmentation in the portfolio matrix.;0;;;;;
The figure also shows a large number of items with a relatively low value, implying administrative chores for purchasers.;1;;;;;
Dependence on suppliers is reflected in higher prices or unfavorable conditions.;3;;;;;
One objective would be to lower the number of bottleneck items.;3;;;;;
Regarding bottleneck item, there are concerns with respect to the assurance of supply.;3;;;;;
Forced single sourcing is often seen in this category.;3;;;;;
Contingency plans and emergency stocks are required, negotiating for low prices is not the main focus of purchasing.;3;;;;;
A search for alternatives only takes place in exceptional cases, since the cost of developing and finding alternative ingredients are several times higher than the expected results.;3;;;;;
The strategy for non-critical items is aimed at minimizing the cost of preparing and placing purchase orders.;1;;;;;
Possible options are standardization of procedures, combining of orders and invoices and e-procurement.;1;;;;;
For leverage items purchasing is continuously monitoring the supplier performance and is taking action when a supplier deviates from an agreement.;2;;;;;
In many cases there is an added value to the products, for instance just-in-time delivery, consignment stocks, or the delivery in a special format or packaging.;2;;;;;
Supplier selection is often based on the added value in these areas and obviously cost performance.;2;;;;;
For scarce items the supplier usually is the dominant party in the buyer-supplier relationship.;3;;;;;
The supplier has a strong position when negotiating contract conditions.;3;;;;;
Strategic partnerships are only pursued if a competitive advantage in end markets can be gained.;4;;;;;
Purchasing strategies in general are aimed at adapting and improving conditions, not so much at changing positions in the portfolio matrix.;0;;;;;
Few efforts are made to shift suppliers from the left half to the right half of the matrix.;0;;;;;
These suppliers may provide alternative arrangements in cases of emergency or problems with the current suppliers.;3;;;;;
The success of multinational corporations is considered to be contingent upon the ease and speed by which knowledge is disseminated throughout the organization.;0;;;;;
The dominant conceptualization of the MNC in current research is based on knowledge-based theories of the firm, which considers the MNC as a knowledge sharing network.;0;;;;;
He found that the extent of integration between purchasing and other departments is positively associated with the degree and the scope of international outsourcing.;0;;;;;
It is an example of a multinational business unit in which the portfolio technique is integrated into the daily practice of purchasing and supply management.;0;;;;;
The technique appears to provide a ready communication tool for headquarters to infuse the organization with learning and leadership.;0;;;;;
Directed by headquarters, with R&D and financial inputs, similar and comparable portfolio analyses are performed by 30 plants worldwide.;0;;;;;
These 30 affiliates supposedly understand their own local markets.;0;;;;;
The portfolio analyses are carried out according to strict guidelines.;0;;;;;
Targets are set based on the outcomes of the portfolio analyses.;0;;;;;
Apart from the lead buying system, the coordination of procurement is rather limited.;0;;;;;
Our findings cast doubt on the effectiveness of the organizational settings which were chosen by the case company.;0;;;;;
As suggested by him, it is difficult to assess the effectiveness of coordination mechanisms and organizational learning.;0;;;;;
The required portfolio analysis, performed by the local plants in accordance with the set guidelines appear to have stimulated the organizational learning of the affiliates.;0;;;;;
The impact on coordination, is less evident.;0;;;;;
The study shows that the portfolio tool forces cross-functional teamwork, which improves the internal coordination within business units, but not across business units.;0;;;;;
The pursuit of integration and coordination of procurement across worldwide business units is commendable.;0;;;;;
The daily reality of global purchasing in a MNC shows considerable resistance to giving up autonomy.;0;;;;;
A critical challenge would be to get the autonomous business units to collaborate more in the area of purchasing and global sourcing.;0;;;;;
Our contribution to the research stream on knowledge development and sharing within MNCs relates to the transfer of knowledge from headquarters to local units.;0;;;;;
This explorative study details the case of an MNC where headquarters prescribe and control the development and implementation of purchasing strategies by local plants.;0;;;;;
The study shows how the purchasing portfolio tool is used as a means for achieving knowledge transfer to local units.;0;;;;;
Headquarters can function as a catalyst of knowledge leveraging.;0;;;;;
The purchasing portfolio tool appears to facilitate internal coordination, providing a framework for analyzing purchasing problems and possibilities.;0;;;;;
Purchasing goals and purchasing strategies are clearly connected to the results of the different portfolio matrices.;0;;;;;
The study suggests that the portfolio tool forces cross-functional teamwork, which improves the internal coordination within business units, but not necessarily across business units.;0;;;;;
Within business units, there are natural tensions between functional departments which may inhibit the full execution of a real global sourcing strategy.;0;;;;;
There is an area of tension between purchasing and marketing departments.;0;;;;;
Combining orders for standarized products can lead to more efficiency.;1;;;;;
Increasing efficiency is key to noncritical items.;1;;;;;
Purchasing managers are always looking for possibilities to simplify and standardize products.;1;;;;;
The demands of marketing and customers set boundaries on purchasing s natural propensity for controlling and reducing cost.;0;;;;;
Business units are by definition autonomous and empowered.;0;;;;;
Our main focus with regard to the purchasing and supplier network in 2009 was to continue the previous years initiative of creating the most efficient value-added chain in the automotive industry.;0;;;;;
Working closely with our suppliers, we made further progress in reducing the cost of materials for vehicle projects both in the development and series production stages.;4;;;;;
Particular attention was paid to maintaining the high level of quality expected by our customers.;0;;;;;
The purchasing department was supported in this process by the development team, particularly in its consistent application of modular solutions.;0;;;;;
These items have a low supply risk.;1;;;;;
The increased use of standardised components enables both time and costs to be reduced across all models.;1;;;;;
Important milestones were therefore set in 2009 with regards to the future purchasing arrangements for the BMW 1 and 3 Series successor models.;0;;;;;
The consequences of the worldwide financial and economic crisis particularly affected the automotive supply industry during the year under report.;0;;;;;
Declining production volumes coupled with simultaneously decreasing liquidity levels and rising financing costs had a significant impact on the financial stability of the supplier market, resulting ina greater incidence of crisis situations among suppliers at a national and international level.;0;;;;;
A consistent strategy of risk and intervention management enabled the various crises to be successfully mastered without having a lasting detrimental effect on supply security or car production quality.;4;;;;;
We continued to expand our international purchasing network with great determination in 2009.;0;;;;;
By concentrating on the regions for new purchase volumes, we were able to make optimal use of cost advantages, while also expanding the scope of so-called natural hedging the strategy of purchasing in foreign currencies to minimise exchange risks.;2;;;;;
Regional experts with a good understanding of purchasing, quality and logistics issues analyse the various procurement markets and suppliers in close cooperation with centralised management functions. ;4;;;;;
This strategy will enable us to achieve cost and currency benefits on purchases for future models.;0;;;;;
The basis for this was laid in 2009 with the selection of suppliers for the BMW 1 Series and 3 Series models. We continued to expand our international purchasing network with great determination in 2009.;0;;;;;
Suppliers and their partners must provide detailed proof of their compliance with the required standards for sustainability in order to take part in the tendering procedure.;0;;;;;
As part of the selection process, our experts check whether prospective suppliers are complying with the required standards.;0;;;;;
The establishment of a joint venture with the Group was an important step in gaining access to innovations in the field of lightweight construction.;4;;;;;
This joint venture has been set up to manufacture carbon fibre and textile semi-finished products for use in automotive construction.;4;;;;;
A primary selection criterion was our requirement for the use of environmentally friendly sources of energy in both the production and the recycling of carbon fibres.;2;;;;;
We have also started working, a joint venture, forming alliances with two further world market leaders in the field of electromobility.;4;;;;;
As supplier of the battery cells that are to power our future project, the Megacity Vehicle, SB Limotiveoffers state-of-the-art technology, bringing together German automotive expertise and Korean battery-makingknow-how.;0;;;;;
The cash flow statements of the BMW Group and the Automobiles and Financial Services segments show thesources and applications of cash flows for the financial years 2008 and 2009, classified into cash flows fromoperating, investing and financing activities.;0;;;;;
Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement correspond to the amount disclosed in the balance sheet. Cash flows from operating activities are determined indirectly starting with the Group net profit.;0;;;;;
By contrast, cashflows from investing and financing activities are based onactual payments and receipts.;0;;;;;
Operating activities of the BMW Group generated a positive cash flow of euro 10,271 million in 2009, a decrease ofeuro 601 million or 5.5 % compared to the previous year.;0;;;;;
Changes in working capital and other operating assetsand liabilities during 2009 generated a cash inflow of euro908 million (2008: euro 411 million).;0;;;;;
The increase was morethan offset by the decrease in depreciation and writedowns on leased products (down by euro 1,287 million toeuro 5,476 million).The cash outflow for investing activities amounted to euro11,328 million and was therefore euro 7,324 million lowerthan in 2008.;0;;;;;
Capital expenditure for intangible assets and property, plant and equipment resulted in the cash outflowfor investing activities decreasing by euro 733 million ona year-on-year comparison.;0;;;;;
The cash outflow for the netinvestment in leased products and receivables from salesfinancing decreased by euro 8,692 million to euro 5,700million as a result of the lower level of new business andthe fact that an exceptional item in the previous year wasnot repeated (buy-back in 2008 of previously off-balancesheet vehicle portfolio of a leasing company).Financing activities generated a cash inflow of euro 1,352million in 2009 (2008: euro 12,904 million).;0;;;;;
Cash inflows from the issue of bonds totalled euro 9,762 million (2008:euro 9,959 million), and euro 6,440 million (2008: euro5,080 million) was used to repay bonds.;0;;;;;
The dividend payment for the financial year 2009 amounted to euro 197million.;0;;;;;
In order to reduce these risks, derivative financial instruments are used that serve to hedge purchase price fluctuations agreed with suppliers with respect to the raw material content of purchases.;1;;;;;
Changes in the fair values of these derivatives, which generally track the quoted market prices of the raw material being hedged, gives rise to market pricerisks for the Group.;1;;;;;
If the market prices of hedged raw materials had been 10% higher (lower) at 31 December 2009, the Group profit before tax would have been euro 110 million higher (euro 110 million lower).;0;;;;;
The risks from financial instruments used inthis context were not material to the Group in the past andat the end of the reporting period.;0;;;;;
A description of howthese risks are managed is provided in the Group Management Report on pags 64 et seq.;0;;;;;
Information regardingthe residual value risk from operating leases is provided inthe section on accounting policies.;0;;;;;
Increasing internationalisation and the growing complexity prevailing on procurement markets as well as within the production network prompted us to reorganise the purchasing function in 2010 along the lines of technological product groups.;0;;;;;
The main focuses of this strategy are to concentrate responsibilities worldwide and further improve our understanding of marketand technological developments. ;0;;;;;
The closer coordination of production and purchasing activities for the plastic outer skin of the vehicle has enabled us to generate significant synergies within the process chain.;4;;;;;
This enables us to decide, quickly and competently, whether components should be produced in-house or externally ordered.;0;;;;;
We have identified a double-digitnumber of components that could be jointly purchased.The cooperation arrangements only involve components that do not contribute towards differentiating between the two brands and which therefore have no impact on competition.;0;;;;;
Plans are under way to extend the cooperation arrangements step by step to cover a larger number of parts and components.;1;;;;;
The two companies intend to work together in evaluating audit results and checking the qualifications of suppliers. ;0;;;;;
Adequate provisions have been recognised in the balance sheet to cover any such claims.;0;;;;;
Part of the risk, especially wherethe US market is concerned, has been insured ex ternally up to economically acceptable levels.;0;;;;;
The high quality of our products, additionally ensured by regular quality audits and ongoing improvement measures, helps toreduce this risk.;0;;;;;
In comparison with competitors, this can give rise to benefits and opportunities for the BMW Group.;0;;;;;
 Joint purchasing also presents excellent opportunities.;1;;;;;
In order to reduce these risks, derivative financial instruments are used that serve to hedge purchase price fluctuations agreed with suppliers with respect to the raw material content of purchases.;1;;;;;
Changes in the fair values of these derivatives, which generally track the quoted marketprices of the raw material being hedged, gives rise to market price risks for the Group.;0;;;;;
Activities can only be sustainable, however, if they encompass the entire value-added chain.;0;;;;;
That is why the BMW Group not only makes high demands of itself but also expects its suppliers and partners to meet the ecological and social standards it sets.;0;;;;;
The relevant sustainability criteria therefore play an integral part in all aspects of purchasing terms and conditions as well as for the purposes of evaluating suppliers.;0;;;;;
Potential suppliers must submit a full disclosure when completing BMW sustainability questionnaire, an inherent component ofthe acceptance procedure for potential new suppliers.;0;;;;;
Purchasing and Supplier Network developed further Throughout 2011 we continued the process of globalising our supplier network.;0;;;;;
Alongside the issue of securing supplies, we also focused on parts quality.;3;;;;;
Having organisational structures in place that effectively bundle responsibility for purchasing, logistics and parts quality enables us to successfully secure supplies for production with greater efficiency, even when working at full capacity.;1;;;;;
Tight networking with our suppliers is seen as a key issue, particularly regarding access to innovations.;4;;;;;
We created the Supplier Innovation Award to honour outstanding innovation in our vehicles.;4;;;;;
We continued to internationalise our supply chain, particularly with the new product.;0;;;;;
In this endeavour we were again successful in improving our cost base and the quality of supplies.;0;;;;;
An important step in the direction of electromobility and BMWi was taken with the production start of the BMW Active Etest fleet.;0;;;;;
To this end we set up our own organisational unit in China with responsibility for purchasing, logistics and quality.;0;;;;;
Simultaneously we broadened our purchasing activities for future vehicle projects in Europe and the NAFTA region.;1;;;;;
We always give particular consideration to local partners present in the various production markets.;1;;;;;
Multi-currency ordering enables us to pay for the various elements in the value-added chain in the relevant foreign currencies.;0;;;;;
Joint Venture and technological edge in manufacturing Production processes at the plant were further optimised and value streams designed to achieve even greater efficiency.;4;;;;;
In recognition of the improvements achieved, the Landshut plant was presented with the Lean Production Award 2011 for the bestvalue-added chain.;0;;;;;
We also raised production capacities at the BMW Leipzig plant for plastic outer skin components.;0;;;;;
 The high standards that we apply were recognised againin 2011 by inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, in which the BMW Group is one of the top threein the Supply Chain category.;0;;;;;
As part of a policy of preventative risk management implemented within the purchasing function, suppliers area assessed for technical competence on the one hand and financial strength on the other, during both the development and production phases of our vehicles.;1;;;;;
We are also increasingly taking steps to deal with suppliers risks at a local level.;0;;;;;
A Supplier Relationship Management system, which also takes account of social and ecological aspects, helps to reduce risks connected with purchasing activities.;3;;;;;
Material supplies were fully assured at all times by means of appropriate early-intervention measures.;1;;;;;
As the leading provider of premium automobiles, together with its partners the BMW Group operates the most efficient supply chain in the automotive industry. ;0;;;;;
Moreover, we have made it a key aim to promote our own innovative strengths and those of our suppliers to enhance our position as the leading provider of innovations in the premium segment.I;0;;;;;
BMW successfully launched six new derivatives of the 1, 3, 5 and 6 Series.;0;;;;;
MINI successfully introduced its CoupÃ©, whileRolls-Royce Motor Cars brought its Phantom Series II onto the market.;0;;;;;
Particularly worthy of mention are thelaunch in 2012 of the BMW 6 Series Gran CoupÃ© andthe two hybrid vehicles, the BMW ActiveHybrid 3 andBMW ActiveHybrid 5.;0;;;;;
The BMW Group also introducedthe extended-wheelbase version of the BMW 3 SeriesSedan to the Chinese market and brought out revisedversions of the BMW 7 Series and the X1 in order to satisfy rising demand in the fast-growing markets of China, India, Brazil and Russia.;0;;;;;

The carbon fibre cores produced at the plant are processed to form CFRP body parts and subsequently delivered, where production commence during the course of 2013.;0;;;;;
This investment in technology provides the basis for large-scale automated series production of carbon-fibre parts and is animportant aspect of the BMW Groups long-term light weight construction strategy.;1;;;;;
For the time being at least, the BMW Group is in a unique position within the automotive industry.;0;;;;;
As such, the plant constitutes a key element of the Group logistics arrangements.;0;;;;;
 Sustainability within the value-added chainsSustainability criteria are a fundamental part of our purchasing terms and conditions and supplier assessments.;0;;;;;
Among other requirements, we expect our suppliers toguarantee that sub-suppliers also comply with our exacting standards.;0;;;;;
Our Top Two position in the Supply Chain category of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index in2012 is testament to the high standards we set.;0;;;;;
Further information on risk management procedures applied within the Purchasing and Supplier network is provided in the risk report.;0;;;;;
Sustainability aspects also play a key role in the selection and assessment of our suppliers.;0;;;;;
The customary distribution of tasks between manufacturers and suppliers within the automotive sector creates economic benefits, but also exposes contracting parties to a certain degree of mutual dependence.;0;;;;;
As part of a policy of preventative risk management implemented within the purchasing function, suppliers are assessed for technical competence on the one hand and financial strength on the other, during both the development and production phases of our vehicles.;0;;;;;
Suppliers risks at a local level also play an increasingly important role in the context of decision-making.;3;;;;;
As part of our catalogue of procedures, for instance, we also assess the extent to which supplier sites are exposed to natural hazards, such as floods or earthquakes, thus reducingour exposure to parts supply risks.;0;;;;;
In this context, we manage sustainability risks using a systematic three-stage risk management approach, comprising risk filters, modularly designed supplier risk evaluation questionnaires and external sustainability audits.;0;;;;;
In addition to managing risk, we are also constantly on the alert to identify opportunities, including options for using resources more efficiently. ;3;;;;;
Material supplies were nevertheless fully assured at all times by means of appropriate early intervention measures.;1;;;;;
Medium and long-term purchase contracts with fixed pricing arrangements for raw materials such as steel and plastics are also in place.;4;;;;;
A description of the methods applied for risk measurement and hedging is provided in the notes to the Group Financial Statements.;0;;;;;
As the leading provider of premium vehicles, the BMW Group operates the supply chain together with its partners.;0;;;;;
The focus here is on achieving the right balance between quality, innovation, flexible supply structures and competitive costs.;0;;;;;
The BMW i3 incorporates a large number of innovations, implemented thanks to the coordinated efforts of our suppliers and our own in-house component manufacturing resources.;0;;;;;
Furthermore,the new generation of the MINI marks the start of frontwheel drive architecture for the BMW Group.;0;;;;;
In accordance with the basic principle applied that production follows the market, the BMW Group is increasingly shifting value-added processes into its respective sales markets, thus providing a further defence againstcurrency exposures.;0;;;;;
The Purchasing and Supplier team is also responsible for component production sites and carries out regular comparative analyses to ensure the efficiency supplier netwoRk of our in-house component production facilities.;1;;;;;
The expansion of the Landshut production plant for carbon fibre parts emphasises the importance that they attach to it as a competence centre for lightweight construction and electromobility.;0;;;;;
This investment in technology provides the basis for the large scale automated series production of carbon fibre parts in the Group.;1;;;;;
The increasing trend towards modular-based production with a set of common architectures covering various models and product lines exacerbates the consequences of the loss of a supplier or failure to supply on time.;2;;;;;
As part of the supplier preselection process, the BMW Group is careful to ensure that its future business partners come up to the same high ecological, social and corporate governance standards by which the BMW Group is generally measured.;0;;;;;
Suppliers are assessed on the basis of the BMW Group Sustainability Standard which is applied throughout the worldwide supplier network.;0;;;;;
The principal tool for ensuring compliance with the BMW Group Sustainability Standard is a three stage sustainability and risk management approach comprising a BMW Group-specific sustainability risk filter, a sustainability questionnaire and a sustainability audit.;0;;;;;
In addition, the technical and financial capabilities of suppliers especially those supplying for modularbased production are continuously monitored during both the development and production phases of the Groups vehicles.;0;;;;;
Supplier sites are assessed for exposure to natural hazards, such as floods or earthquakes,in order to identify supply risks at an early stage and implement appropriate countermeasures.Raw materials management procedures are in place tomitigate the risk of a production interruption due toshortages of supplies of critical raw materials.;0;;;;;
The supply risk is also reduced by developing and implementing systems governing minimum inventory levels.;1;;;;;
The primary focus of the BMW Group purchasing and logistics activities is to achieve an optimal balance of quality, innovation, flexible supply structures and competitive cost.;0;;;;;
We go to great lengths to design the supply chain with our business partners, thus ensuring that we can react rapidly and flexibly at all times to fluctuations in order volumes. ;4;;;;;
Most of the BMW start-ups were concentrated on Europe and the NAFTA region.;0;;;;;
The production start of the new X4 at the Spartanburg plant resulted in a broader supplier base within the NAFTA region.;0;;;;;
Close collaboration with external business partners and the Groups own in-house component production team resulted in the introduction of numerous innovations.;4;;;;;
For the BMW Group, it will also entail a further increase in NAFTA-based purchases in the coming years, whilst at the same time contributing to currency hedging.;0;;;;;
In view of these developments, the BMW Groups decentralised organisational structures in the NAFTA region have been strengthened and newly aligned.;0;;;;;
Important chassis and drive components for the BMW i models are produced at the Dingolfing plant.;0;;;;;
The active management of sustainability risks along the supplier chain reduces compliance and image risks.;0;;;;;
With this in mind, the BMW Group has integrated a comprehensive system of sustainability management in its purchasing processes.;0;;;;;
Despite the environment, the Purchasing and Supplier Network ensures that the Groupis capable of flexibly responding to fluctuations in demand when purchasing production materials, raw materials, capital goods and services.;1;;;;;
The main focusis on high quality standards, innovation, a flexible and reliable supply structure and competitive costs.;1;;;;;
The Group remains committed to its strategy of maintaining a regionally balanced growth in sales volume, production and purchasing volumes.;4;;;;;
This strategy also makes an important contribution to natural hedging against currency risks.;0;;;;;
Investments in state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities and efficient structures ensure the competitiveness of in-housecomponent production.;0;;;;;
Research will be conducted at the centre on new materials, composite material concepts and production processes for future vehicle generations, encompassing a wide range of technologies.;0;;;;;
Activities include the procurement and quality assurance of production materials, raw materials, capital goods and services.;1;;;;;
External suppliers are selected systematically on the basis of competitiveness according to the criteria of quality, innovation, flexibility and cost.;1;;;;;
The risk of individual suppliers suffering capacity bottlenecks increased during the period under report, mainly reflecting the huge rise in volumes that needed to be mastered.;3;;;;;
Activities have been focused particularly on the ability to respond quickly to changing demand for various types of drive train technology. ;3;;;;;
In order to ensure over the long term the flexibility and competitiveness of internal component production, the BMW Group invests in state-of-the-art production facilities and efficient structures. ;0;;;;;
The BMW Group has therefore integrated comprehensive sustainability management in its purchasing processes. ;0;;;;;
Production problems incurred by suppliers could lead to increase dexpenditure for the BMW Group through to interruptions in production and a corresponding reduction in sales.;0;;;;;
The increasing complexity of the supplier network, especially at the level of lower tier suppliers, whose operations can only be indirectly influenced by the Group, is a further potential cause of downtimes at supplier locations.;3;;;;;
The increased threat of IT attacks on the supplier network in particular has resulted in a more critical assessment of the risk situation.;3;;;;;
If purchasing risks materialised, they could have a high earnings impact over the two-year period.;0;;;;;
The risk amount attached to purchasing risksi s classified as high.;0;;;;;
The analysis of raw material price risk is based on planned purchases of raw materials and components containing those raw materials.;1;;;;;
If risks relating to raw material prices were to materialise, they would likely have a low earnings impact over the two year assessment period.;0;;;;;
A low risk level is attached to these risks.;0;;;;;
Significant opportunities could arise if raw material prices developed favourably for the Group.;1;;;;;
Changes in commodity prices are monitored on the basis of a well-defined management process.;1;;;;;
Theprincipal objective is to increase planning reliability for the BMW Group.;0;;;;;
Price fluctuations for precious metals, non-ferrousmetals and, to some extent, for steel and steel ingredients and energy are hedged using financial derivatives or supply contracts with fixed pricing arrangements;0;;;;;
As a large-scale manufacturing company, the group is exposed to purchase price risks, particularly in relation to raw materials used in vehicle production.;3;;;;;
The analysis of raw material price risk is based on planned purchases of raw materials and components containing those raw materials.;0;;;;;
If risks relating to raw material prices were to materialise, they would likely have a low earnings impact over the two year assessment period.;0;;;;;
A low risk level is attached to these risks.;0;;;;;
Significant opportunities could arise if raw material prices developed favourably for the Group.;1;;;;;
Changes in commodity prices are monitored on the basis of a well-defined management process.;1;;;;;
The principal objective is to increase planning reliability for the BMW Group.;0;;;;;
With its purchasing strategy, the Group is pursuing the goal of increasing its own competitiveness and at the same time contributing towards cutting customs costs.;4;;;;;
Thisis achieved, for example, through localisation in free trade areas with minimum requirements in terms of local value creation and through the intelligent controlling of material flows within a global network. ;0;;;;;
The BMW Group purchasing function also works to ensure the greatest possible flexibility to allow for short-term changes in trade policy.;0;;;;;
Purchasing risks relate primarily to supply risks caused by the failure of a supplier as well as risks associated with the quality of bought-in parts.;0;;;;;
Production problems incurred by suppliers could lead to increased expenditure for the BMW Group through to interruptions in production and a corresponding reduction in sales.;3;;;;;
The increased threat of cyber attacks along the supplier chain also give cause for a more critical assessment of the risk situation, in this case in anticipation of future potential risks relating to security of supply and the protection of internal know-how.;3;;;;;
If purchasing risks were to materialise, they could have a high earning simpact over the two-year assessment period.;0;;;;;
The risk amount attached to purchasing risks is classified as high.;0;;;;;
Close cooperation between carmakers and suppliers in the development and production of vehicles and the provision of services generates economic benefits, but also increased dependency.;4;;;;;
Potential reasons for the failure of individual suppliers include in particular increased IT-related risk, non-compliance with sustainability or quality standards, insufficient financial strength of a supplier, the occurrence of natural hazards, fires and insufficient supply of rawmaterials.;0;;;;;
In order to ensure a uniform level of security for all parties concerned along the added valuesupply chain, the BMW Group focuses on obtaining evidence of appropriate IT security certification fromits suppliers.;0;;;;;
As part of supplier pre-selection, the BMW Group checks for compliance with the sustainability standards for the supplier network.;0;;;;;
This includes compliance with internationally recognised human rights and applicable labour and social standards.;0;;;;;
The principal means for ensuring compliance with the Sustainability Standards is a three-stage risk management system for sustainability.;0;;;;;
The technical and financial capabilities of suppliers are monitored, especially where modular-based production is concerned.;2;;;;;
Supplier sites are assessed for exposure to natural hazards, such as floods or earthquakes, in order to identify supply risks at an early stage and implement appropriate precautions.;0;;;;;
In order to minimise supply risks of raw materials, the BMW Group draws up measures to reduce the use of raw materials or to substitute alternative raw materials.;1;;;;;
In order to attain a very high level of quality, it may become necessary to invest in new technological concepts or discontinue planned innovations, with the result that the cost of materials could exceed levels accounted for.;3;;;;;
By monitoring and developing global suppliermarkets, the Group continuously strives to optimise its competitiveness by working together with the world best product and service providers.;4;;;;;
Obviously, not all buyer-supplier relationships are to bemanaged in the same way.;0;;;;;
Research findings indicate that successful supply chain management requires the effective and efficient management of a portfolio of relationships (Bensaou 1999).;0;;;;;
Kraljic (1983) introduced the first, comprehensive portfolio approach for the use in purchasing and supply management.;0;;;;;
By categorizing products in a 2x2 matrix, sensible guidelines were given for managing supplier relationships.;0;;;;;
The Kraljic portfolio approach is generally considered as an important breakthrough in the development of theory in the field ofpurchasing and supply management (Syson 1992).;0;;;;;
In general, purchasing portfolio models aim at developingand implementing differentiated purchasing strategies.;0;;;;;
Web-based procurement of MRO items (Croom 2000), specification processes (Nellore 2000), engineering purchasing-supplier interaction (Nellore and Taylor 2000), facilitation of an internal process of change (Axelsson etal.;0;;;;;
2000), and interorganizational competence development situations (Momme 2000).;0;;;;;
Still, Kraljicâs fundamental ideas and concepts dominate the discipline.;0;;;;;
The purpose of this article is to provide new perspectives on Kraljics model, reporting on some important advancements in the use of a portfolio approach in purchasing and supply management.;0;;;;;
This article addresses a major problem area with respect to Kraljics approach: the nature of the strategic recommendations.;0;;;;;
The results are based on a case study research, conducted at a large industrial company that is structured around a number of fairly autonomous business groups.;0;;;;;
Its general idea is to minimize supply risk and make the most of buying power.;2;;;;;
This explains the choice of dimensions: accounting for risk on the one hand, and using buying power on the other hand.;0;;;;;
Kraljic approach includes the construction of a portfolio matrix that classifies products on the basis of two dimensions: profit impact and supply risk;0;;;;;
Each category requires a distinctive approach toward suppliers (see Figure 1).;0;;;;;
Non-critical items require efficient processing, product standardization, order volume, and inventory optimization.;1;;;;;
Leverage items allow the buying company to exploit its full purchasing power, for instance through tendering, target pricing, and product substitution.;2;;;;;
Bottleneck items cause a lot of problems and risks. ;3;;;;;
Volume insurance should be realized by means of supplier control, security of inventories, and backup plans.;3;;;;;
A further analysis of the strategic items is recommended.;4;;;;;
Purchasing portfolio analysis has subsequently become the dominant approach to what the profession regards as operational professionalism.;0;;;;;
Kraljic (1983) made a reasonable case for the usefulness of the portfolio approach by describing the experiences of some large industrial companies.;0;;;;;
Now, many years later, the purchasing portfolio approach is being used by several other large companies, for instance Shell, Alcatel, Philips, AkzoNobel, OcÃ©, and Siemens (van Weele 2000).;0;;;;;
In a survey of Dutch companies, Boodie (1997) found that nearly 50 percent of the responding purchasing managers indicated that they used Kraljic for formulating purchasing strategies.;0;;;;;
Of the large companies, with more than 5,000 employees, 85 percent reported to use the portfolio analysis.;0;;;;;
In contrast with the growing popularity of portfolio techniques, there is a lack of empirical research providing insights and evidence on their actual use.;0;;;;;
Based on an extensive literature review, Olsen and Ellram(1997b) concluded that normative research is needed on how to manage different types of buyer-supplier relationships.;0;;;;;
Current research does not reveal how purchasing professionals handle the problem of positioning commodities and suppliers into the portfolio, how they actually develop purchasing strategies, and what results are derived from using portfolio techniques.;0;;;;;
Through this in-depth case study, which is to be followed by others, the authors try to overcome these shortcomings. ;0;;;;;
Strategic recommendations for the portfolio categories are usually summarized into simple concepts, like  volume insurance.;3;;;;;
If one takes a closer look at the nature of these strategic recommendations, one must conclude that they are rather generic by nature, providing only rough indications for the most appropriate supplier strategies.;0;;;;;
Moreover, they merely react and adapt to prevailing circumstances, taking the current power and dependence structure within the supply chain for granted.;0;;;;;
Purchasing professionals could always look for possibilities to move to other, strategically more attractive positions in the matrix.;0;;;;;
It is not clear if and how other positions in the matrix are to be pursued through the implementation of a recommended purchasing strategy (Gelderman 2000).;0;;;;;
The Kraljic framework does not provide guidelines for moving commodities and/or suppliers around the different categories. ;0;;;;;
First, because of the apparently limited research on the actual use and possibilities of purchasing portfolio approaches.;0;;;;;
Publications are conceptual or anecdotal by nature.;0;;;;;
Second, case study research is preferable when the research questions focus mainly on.;0;;;;;
The authors wanted to gain insights in the use and the possibilities of a portfolio approach, exploring and identifying the advanced practices of an experienced company.;0;;;;;
The questions in the research deal with exploratory issues, rather than frequencies or incidence.;0;;;;;
Firms frequently procure a large quantity and variety of products, works and services to execute their operational responsibilities and satisfy various plans and policies of the organization.;0;;;;;
The purchasing strategies, tend to have a large influence on the overall performance of the organization.;0;;;;;
There is an imperative that the firms employ a professional purchasing approach.;0;;;;;
Kraljic proposed a purchasing portfolio modeling approach, where the strategy was based on classifying purchase items into four portfolio quadrants vis-a-vis their relative contribution towards supply risk and profit impact for the firm.;0;;;;;
As such, the Kraljic Portfolio Matrix (KPM) aims at matching external risks and opportunities with the internal needs of the buying firm (Duboisand Pedersen, 2002).;0;;;;;
Furthermore, the KPM seems to handle the power dependence problemsbalance, exploit, and diversifyin many purchasing situations by focusing on how to exploit the firms purchasing power vis-a-vis suppliers and reduce the risk to an acceptable minimum (Caniels and Gelderman, 2007 Â¨ ).;0;;;;;
Furthermore, Gelderman and Semeijn (2006) have suggested that the KPM framework facilitates internal coordination and places emphasis on cross-functional teamwork to improve the internal coordination within business units.;0;;;;;
"While the KPM has significantly influenced professional purchasing and inspired academic research till this day (e.g., Lee and Drake,2010; Pagell et al., 2010; Terpend et al., 2011), it has also received a fair degree of criticism.";0;;;;;
In sum, the KPM is an effective tool for discussing, visualizing and illustrating the possibilities of the development of differentiated purchasing strategies (Gelderman and Van Weele, 2005, p. 21), and thus has been characterized as one of the best single diagnostic and prescriptive tools for purchasing and supply management (Syson, 1992).;0;;;;;
Selecting the dimensions, such as supply risk and profit impactis challenging , and the factors that determine the dimensions of the KPM are difficult to obtain.;0;;;;;
Giving weights to these dimensions is a difficult task, positioning of the items in the portfolio matrix by the purchasing managers are subjective and makes the portfolio models imprecise.;0;;;;;
 Involving suppliers to assign different purchasing strategies to commodities. ;4;;;;;
It also faces demarcation problems with respect to its dimensions due to the subjective categorization of the commodities for placing themin the KPM using dichotomous variables for both supply risk and profit impact.;0;;;;;
It proposes the use of a fuzzy multi-attribute decision making approach to assign the importance weights to different supply risk and profitimpact dimensions, and further, to incorporate a MultidimensionalScaling approach to objectively position the commodities in a continuous scale of 1 to 1 for appropriate classification in theKPM.;0;;;;;
We apply our approach by positioning the major works and services procured by the Rural Development Department of a state government in India around the KPM framework.;0;;;;;
"Over the years, a large number of scholars has contributed to the research on purchasing portfolio models by proposing and/or empirically investigating new portfolio dimensions and perspectives for classifying commodities (e.g., Olsen and Ellram, 1997;Nellore and Soderquist, 2000) Â¨ or suppliers (e.g., Buvik and Reve,2001; Mota and Castro, 2005; Tang, 1999).";0;;;;;
Besides the more traditional internal (e.g., purchasing volume, strategic importance) and external (e.g., supply market risk, rate of innovation) dimensions and perspectives, more extensive ones, such as patterns of the firm strategic intent for a given purchase, the environment in which a purchase is made, and the stances adopted by buyers in dealing with their suppliers (Terpend et al., 2011, p. 75) have lately been proposed and investigated.;0;;;;;
All this research has in common that it mostly builds on and extends the portfolio matrix proposed by Kraljic (1983).;0;;;;;
There is also vast literature that used purchasing portfolio approaches to derive recommendations for firm purchasing strategies, buyersupplier relationships, or organizational structures.;0;;;;;
A common understanding is also that all commodities and buyer supplier relationships are to be administered differently while assigning purchasing strategies to different commodities or suppliers, because the characteristics of commodities or buyersupplier relationships (or groups thereof) differ from one another.;0;;;;;
For example, Ramsay (1994) explored the interdependency of relationships between buyers and suppliers, where in the relationship depends on the attractiveness of the offer made by both groups based on the availability of resources with them.;0;;;;;
They used a contingency-inspired framework to model the relationships among products internal cooperation and inter-organizational relations.;4;;;;;
They described the interfirm relationship considering transaction cost analysis.;4;;;;;
They used asset specificity, frequency of economic exchange, and uncertainty associated with the exchange of resources between the buyer and supplier as the core dimensions of a transaction.;0;;;;;
Zolkiewski and Turnbull (2002) identified three sets of relationshipscustomer (existing and potential), supplier (existing and potential) and indirect (e.g., government, competitors, suppliers suppliers and regulatory bodieswithin a network.;0;;;;;
They recommended that (1) the firms should identify the organizations that use each of the three or a combination of the three portfolios of relationships and (2) position the organizations within the portfolio of relationships.;0;;;;;
Dubois and Pedersen proposed an industrial network portfolio approach to procure industrial products.;1;;;;;
They explained the development of strategic supplier portfolios considering risks, trade-offs, and interdependencies of relationships between the firm and its suppliers.;4;;;;;
Kamann (2007) designed a stakeholder based model considering three organizational elements: policies(P), organization (O) and processes (P).;0;;;;;
He described three POP elements that help to translate the selected organizational strategy into an appropriate supplier strategy and to clarify the idealized mix of suppliers in terms of portfolio archetypes.;0;;;;;
Kraljic (1983) suggested that all commodities and all buyer supplier relationships are not to be managed in the same way.;0;;;;;
The purchasing portfolio model aims at developing differentiated purchasing and supplier strategies through classifying commodities on the basis of two dimensions: supply risk and profit impact .;0;;;;;
The general idea is to classify the commodities as per their preferred purchasing strategy that leads to minimize the supply risk and make most out of the buying power to enhance the purchasing performance and the yield oforganizations.;0;;;;;
1).Each of the four categories requires a distinctive approach towards suppliers.;0;;;;;
"By plotting the buying strengths against the strengths of the supply market, three basic power positions are identified and associated with three different supplier strategies: balance, exploit, and diversify (Gelderman and Semeijn, 2006;Gelderman and Van Weele, 2003).";0;;;;;
Caniels and Gelderman (2005 Â¨ ,2007) used data from Dutch purchasing professionals to verify the credibility of the Kraljic model and the factors used in the theoretical dimensions of supply risk and profit impact.;0;;;;;
They found theoretical and real situations that largely satisfy the purchasing strategies while assigning different commodities to the KPM.;0;;;;;
Several authors have used similar approaches to determine priority weights.;0;;;;;
For example, Deng (1999) used theFuzzy-Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) approach and showed that by being able to handle imprecise preference ratings of experts, the approach yields better results as compared to the traditional AHP approach used by Haq and Kannan (2006).;0;;;;;
Furthermore, Chouand Chang (2008) and Padhi and Mohapatra (2009) used FuzzySMART and FAHP-SMART (Simple Multi-Attributes Ranking Technique) to evaluate both qualitative and quantitative types ofattributes.;0;;;;;
(2009) used fuzzy membership function to calculate the utility score of the attributes of the inhibiting type.;0;;;;;
In this research we utilize the FAHP-SMART approach of Padhi andMohapatra (2009) to determine the importance weights of the supply risk and profit impact dimensions.;0;;;;;
The application of the methodology for mapping commodities in the KPM is demonstrated with data pertaining to the Rural Development Department (RDD) of a state government in India.;0;;;;;
This RDD procures a large variety and quantity of products, works, and services in order to carry out their normal operational responsibilities to implement various plans and policies.;0;;;;;
The products range from office consumables to scientific equipment, the works range from painting of walls to constructing a bridge, and the services range from transport to consultancy services.;0;;;;;
To procure these commodities, the organization follows various purchasing strategies, including spot purchasing, competitive bidding, request for quotation, rate contract, open cry auction, umbrella agreement and agreement through negotiation (Padhi and Mohapatra, 2010).;0;;;;;
The methodology proposed is applied to the procurement of 20 works and services in the RDD.;0;;;;;
Browsing the website of the departments of state government to learn about the procurement of works and services in the RDD to get the details regarding type of purchasing portfolio used, tender awarding time, type of works and services, and awarded cost of works and services.;0;;;;;
Government departments in India procure 262 types of products,works and services (fewer than 34 headings) to carry out their normal operational responsibilities and to implement various plans and policies (www.tenderindia.com).;0;;;;;
Of these, products, works and services the RDD of the state government purchases 32 types of works/services most frequently.;0;;;;;
Based on the total cost of purchase done bythe RDD in the year 2005â2006 (CMIE July 2005), 20 works/services have been selected that account for the 95% of the annual purchase value employing the Pareto analysis as shown in Fig.;0;;;;;
2.Next, we designed two questionnaires to obtain data pertaining to supply risk and profit impact attributes for various works and services procured by the RDD.;0;;;;;
The first questionnaire addressed the importance scores of the supply risk and profit impact attributes (AppendixA).;0;;;;;
The second questionnaire addressed the identification of a list of major works and services procured by the RDD, and was used for finding out the performance scores with respect to supply risk andprofit impact dimensions (Table 4).;0;;;;;
In each questionnaire, respondents (five for the first and 23 for the second questionnaire) were asked to indicate the degree to which they agree with each statement on a 10-point scale (Table 1).;0;;;;;
In this, the preference distance among Painting works, Warehousing, Repair and maintenance works, Sanitary works, Shed construction, and Fencing/wall works, based on the two aspects ofevaluation criteria is very short (i.e., they are very similar).;0;;;;;
If one takes supply risk and profit impact into account together, then these services are perceived to be the noncritical services (due to low supply risk from contractor side and also have low profit impact).;1;;;;;
However Indian organizations are lagging behind their global counter partsi n adopting the KPM.;0;;;;;
To promote the application of the KPM, the current research used data collected in the Rural Development Department of a state government in India.;0;;;;;
The approaches for positioning commodities in the KPM suggested in the literature are mainly based on subjective judgment of the decision makers to position the commodities in thedifferent quadrants of the KPM.;0;;;;;
They lack analytical rigor, where subjective positioning of commodities may lead to erroneous outcomes and may adversely affect the outcome of purchasing strategy implementation.;0;;;;;
To position the commodities in the KPM, this research employs the fuzzy multi-utility scoring approach to determine the importance weights of the supply risk and profit impact dimensions andattributes and preference scores of the works and services.;1;;;;;
The MDS approach was performed to identify and position the similar groups of works/services using the Euclidean distance measure of the preferences scores obtained.;0;;;;;
Thereafter, government procurement experts were asked to evaluate and verify the position of the works/services, obtained from the proposed analysis, to obtain a clear visual dimensional map.;0;;;;;
The proposed approach is managerially relevant since it improves the quality and confidence of managerial judgment.;0;;;;;
Moreover, the proposed approach reduces the dimensions to supply risk and profit impact and facilitates a clear representation of the dimensions to map the works/services to the four quadrants of the KPM.;0;;;;;
As the supply risk and profit impact attributes are dynamic andchange with time, in future one can investigate new attributes thatpotentially contribute to the two dimensions of the KPM whilemapping the works/services.;0;;;;;
Involvement of suppliers in the survey for classifying the works/services should also be explored.;0;;;;;
Within the Purchasing and Supplier Network, opportunities arise above all in the area of global sourcing through increased efficiency and the use of innovations developed by suppliers, which can lead to a broader range of products.;2;;;;;
Making full use of location specific cost factors, in particular through local supplier structures in close proximity to new and existing production plants and the introduction of new, innovative production technologies, could lead to lower cost of materials.;1;;;;;
One goal of the BMW Group is to manufacture battery cells in Europe and to establish the relevant value chain for cell production.;0;;;;;
In order to secure Group electrification strategy, a contract was signed for the supply of battery cells.;3;;;;;
The plant is currently under construction in Thuringia.;0;;;;;
The Group offers innovative suppliers numerous possibilities for creating specific contractual arrangements which are attractive for those developing innovative solutions.;4;;;;;
At regular intervals, the BMW Group honours its most inventive suppliers with the Supplier Innovation Award.;0;;;;;
The BMW Group expects these opportunities to have no significant earnings impact over the assessment period as compared to the assumptions made in the outlook.;0;;;;;
The international orientation of the Purchasing and Supplier Network provides the Group with good access to global procurement markets.;4;;;;;
It is responsible for the worldwide procurement and quality assurance of production materials, raw materials, capital goods and services as well as the manufacturing of vehicle components produced in-house.;1;;;;;
External suppliers are selected systematically on the basis of competitiveness according to the criteria of operating excellence,quality, innovation, flexibility, cost and sustainability.;0;;;;;
These criteria also play an essential role in the selection and assessment of suppliers and apply across the entire supplychain.;0;;;;;
Sustainability management therefore creates greater transparency for both the BMW Group andits suppliers.T;0;;;;;
The Group is in continuous contact with battery cell manufacturers and demands disclosure of the origin of this critical raw material.;4;;;;;
It has also made its information on the subject of cobalt, such as the smelters and countries of origin, publicly available and updates it regularly.;0;;;;;
From 2020 onwards, the Group plans to purchase cobalt for fifth-generation battery cells directly from mines in Morocco and Australia and make it available to its supply chain partners.;0;;;;;
The strategy increases transparency regarding the origin of the raw material.;0;;;;;
Phe proportion of purchase volumes attributable to the Americas region grew in 2019, mainly due to the significant increase in vehicle production in Spartanburg,USA, and the start-up of the vehicle plant in San Luis, Mexico.;1;;;;;
Growth in the region will continue in future with the ramping up of production in Mexico.;0;;;;;
DSM, the actual case company, was invited to participate in the research because of its extensive experience with the portfolio approach in a large number of businesses.;0;;;;;
Hence, a selected, limited number of executives and purchasing professionals were interviewed.;0;;;;;
The informants were chosen for their specialized knowledge of and experience with the use of portfolio models in real-life purchasing.;0;;;;;
Of course, the director of purchasing services was used as the prime key informant.;0;;;;;
The choice is justified by the fact that the authors wanted to interview an official with a clear overview of the entire purchasing operation.;0;;;;;
Other informants were chosen through as now balling technique whereby the first informant nominated knowledgeable respondents, i.e., purchasing specialists and business unit managers.;0;;;;;
This, because the authors wanted to include and account for possible differences in experience and views, by confronting the decentral perspectives of the respective business unit managers to the likely more central perspective of the director of purchasing services.;0;;;;;
The interview guide canbe found in the Appendix. ;0;;;;;
The company is divided into 16 business groups that are subsequently subdivided into business units.;0;;;;;
DSM is a sizable customer with a $6 billion (USD) purchase expenditure that represents 70 percent of the firm total revenue.;0;;;;;
An important objective is the achievement of purchasing synergy and leverage across business units.;2;;;;;
DSM operates in a number of global markets where price and cost are always key success factors.;2;;;;;
Pressure on prices and margins is omnipresent, which explains why chemical companies are always looking for opportunities to reduce cost, improve productivity, and improve the value proposition to customers.;0;;;;;
Central to DSM purchasing practice is its strong price performance orientation in its dealings with suppliers.;2;;;;;
It is aimed at starting and guiding strategic discussions with business group management.;0;;;;;
The philosophy of DSM is that the Kraljic matrix should serve as a framework for an in depth discussion with representatives from the business groups involved.;0;;;;;
Preferably, cross-functional teams should decide on and substantiate their points of view with respect to the position of purchases in the matrix.;0;;;;;
For the purchasing portfolio analysis, a Kraljic-likeapproach is being used with comparable dimensions for the classification of products and product categories: (1) the strategic importance of the purchase and (2) the supply risk.;0;;;;;
Views and plans are challengedas an internal warranty of quality.;0;;;;;
The importance of a purchase is assessed in terms of the value added by product line, the percentage of purchased products as part of total cost, and the impact on the company profitability.;0;;;;;
The importance dimension is therefore quite similar to Kraljic originalprofit impact. ;0;;;;;
The drawback of this method is that the validation of measures is limited.;0;;;;;
However, there is no belief in a quantitative approach for measuring values of the dimensions: It is better to be roughly right, than exactly wrong. ;0;;;;;
Points of view have to be substantiated by facts and figures with respect to underlying factors and variables.;0;;;;;
Management is forced into acritical evaluation of supply markets, suppliers, and purchase practices.;0;;;;;
These views are in line with Steele and Court (1996) who considered the lack of objective measurement as a beneficial characteristic.;0;;;;;
Long-term savings are connected to the use of the portfolio approach, be it that the real savings should be attributed to the development and implementation of purchasing and supply strategies.;4;;;;;
An estimated sum of $100 million (can be accounted to a more integrated purchasing approach, taking advantage of the possibilities of leverage and synergy across business groups.;2;;;;;
The portfolio analysis is an important tool, especially for discussing, visualizing and illustrating the possibilities of professional purchasing and supply management.;0;;;;;
In the course of time, the purchasing portfolio approach has contributed to the awareness of purchasing possibilities and the professionalizing of purchasing within the business units/groups.;0;;;;;
To conclude, an important benefit of Kraljicâs portfolio model is that the actualusing and customizing lead to a better understanding of the strategic issues at hand.;0;;;;;
Leverage items are preferred to most other items.;2;;;;;
DSM is always looking for possibilities to move to other, better positions in the matrix, within the bounds of possibility.;0;;;;;
The in-depth interviews identified the most common strategic switches, from one category to another.;0;;;;;
The research revealed conditions leading to the choice of various purchasing strategies and new positions in the matrix;0;;;;;
For the bottleneck items, DSM aims at increasing buying power and developing new opportunities, reducing the dependence on a supplier to an acceptable level.;1;;;;;
An important point concerns the question of whether standardization of requirements is possible.;1;;;;;
 If standardization is not possible, then in the case of processed materials a capacity deal is explored, concentrating purchases to an approved supplier.;2;;;;;
A better deal is made by concentrating regular supply to one supplier.;1;;;;;
A better bottleneck position is pursued by reducing supply risk on the one hand and obtaining a better negotiating position on the other hand.;3;;;;;
Other possibilities within thebottleneck quadrant are: keeping stocks, hedging, Internetbuying, broadening the specifications, searching for alternative sources, risk analysis in combination with contingency planning, and so on.;3;;;;;
The device is: Stay in the corner and make the best of it;0;;;;;
More rigorous is the switch from bottleneck items. ;3;;;;;
Especially MRO items are eligible for such a drastic move.;0;;;;;
Business units have to agree on standardization and pooling of their purchasing requirements.;2;;;;;
Some purchased products are bottleneck items, due to a degree of over specification.;3;;;;;
In a technical environment, there is a natural drive for over specification, and technical specialists tend to settle only for the best.;0;;;;;
A related problem is the incompatability of equipment and MRO items, due to the fact that business units/groups work with their own specifications.;0;;;;;
This enhances the use of buying leverage by standardization and pooling of requirements.;2;;;;;
The idea is to make the end product less complex: the product is aimed at decomplexing.;1;;;;;
In these cases, DSM sets up a team of experts to investigate possibilities of standardization, following the principle of fit-for-use.;1;;;;;
What specifications are really necessary to fit the needs of the business groups/units involved?;0;;;;;
The team chooses the best-fitting standards, striving for more generic specifications.;1;;;;;
This allows for pooling (3b) of requirements across units/groups.;0;;;;;
There are more purchasing and supply possibilities in the case of decomplexed product and, obviously, by pooling purchases the buying power is enhanced.;0;;;;;
In a two-step process, buying leverage is established, provoking leverage in the portfolio matrix.;2;;;;;
The main products in the non-critical category are office supplies and services.;1;;;;;
A key question with respect to these non-production oriented purchases is whether standardization and pooling are possible options or not.;1;;;;;
The product category travel expenses is an example for which pooling (1) is a logical option.;0;;;;;
A framework agreement (master contract) with a preferred supplier is a contractual possibility.;0;;;;;
